Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:2</font>
<td>
Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:3</font>
<td>
According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:4</font>
<td>
Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:5</font>
<td>
And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:6</font>
<td>
And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:7</font>
<td>
And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:8</font>
<td>
For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:9</font>
<td>
But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:10</font>
<td>
Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:11</font>
<td>
For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:12</font>
<td>
Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present truth. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:13</font>
<td>
Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:14</font>
<td>
Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:15</font>
<td>
Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:16</font>
<td>
For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:17</font>
<td>
For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:18</font>
<td>
And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:19</font>
<td>
We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:20</font>
<td>
Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:21</font>
<td>
For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. </table>
