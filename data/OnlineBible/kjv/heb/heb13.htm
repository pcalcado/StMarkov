13:1</font>
<td>
Let brotherly love continue. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
13:2</font>
<td>
Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
13:3</font>
<td>
Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
13:4</font>
<td>
Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
13:5</font>
<td>
Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
13:6</font>
<td>
So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
13:7</font>
<td>
Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation. <tr>

<font size=-1>
13:8</font>
<td>
Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
13:9</font>
<td>
Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied therein. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
13:10</font>
<td>
We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
13:11</font>
<td>
For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
13:12</font>
<td>
Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
13:13</font>
<td>
Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
13:14</font>
<td>
For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
13:15</font>
<td>
By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
13:16</font>
<td>
But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
13:17</font>
<td>
Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable for you. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
13:18</font>
<td>
Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
13:19</font>
<td>

Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant, <tr>

Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen. <tr>

Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you. <tr>

13:24</font>
<td>
Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you. <tr>

Grace be with you all. Amen. </table>
