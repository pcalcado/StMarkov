3:1</font>
<td>
Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:2</font>
<td>
Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:3</font>
<td>
For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:4</font>
<td>
For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all things is God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:5</font>
<td>
And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:6</font>
<td>
But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:7</font>
<td>
Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:8</font>
<td>
Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:9</font>
<td>
When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:10</font>
<td>
Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway err in their heart; and they have not known my ways. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:11</font>
<td>
So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.) <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:12</font>
<td>
Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:13</font>
<td>
But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:14</font>
<td>
For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:15</font>
<td>
While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:16</font>
<td>
For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:17</font>
<td>
But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:18</font>
<td>
And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:19</font>
<td>
So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief. </table>
