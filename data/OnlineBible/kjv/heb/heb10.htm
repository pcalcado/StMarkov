10:1</font>
<td>
For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:2</font>
<td>
For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:3</font>
<td>
But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:4</font>
<td>
For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:5</font>
<td>
Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:6</font>
<td>
In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:7</font>
<td>
Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:8</font>
<td>
Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein; which are offered by the law; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:9</font>
<td>
Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:10</font>
<td>
By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:11</font>
<td>
And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:12</font>
<td>
But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:13</font>
<td>
From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:14</font>
<td>
For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:15</font>
<td>
Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:16</font>
<td>
This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:17</font>
<td>
And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:18</font>
<td>
Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:19</font>
<td>
Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:20</font>
<td>
By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:21</font>
<td>
And having an high priest over the house of God; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:22</font>
<td>
Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:23</font>
<td>
Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;) <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:24</font>
<td>
And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:25</font>
<td>
Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:26</font>
<td>
For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:27</font>
<td>
But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:28</font>
<td>
He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:29</font>
<td>
Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:30</font>
<td>
For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:31</font>
<td>
It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:32</font>
<td>
But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:33</font>
<td>
Partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:34</font>
<td>
For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:35</font>
<td>
Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:36</font>
<td>
For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:37</font>
<td>
For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:38</font>
<td>
Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:39</font>
<td>
But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul. </table>
