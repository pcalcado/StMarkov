8:1</font>
<td>
Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:2</font>
<td>
A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:3</font>
<td>
For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:4</font>
<td>
For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:5</font>
<td>
Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:6</font>
<td>
But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:7</font>
<td>
For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:8</font>
<td>
For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:9</font>
<td>
Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:10</font>
<td>
For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:11</font>
<td>
And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:12</font>
<td>
For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:13</font>
<td>
In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away. </table>
