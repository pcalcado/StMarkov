Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth. <tr>

Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry: <tr>

For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience: <tr>

In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them. <tr>

<td>
Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds; <tr>
<td valign=top>

And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:11</font>
<td>
Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:12</font>

Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering; <tr>
<td valign=top>

Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye. <tr>

And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness. <tr>
