And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day. <tr>

And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:7</font>

And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so. <tr>

And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so. <tr>

And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, <tr>

<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:21</font>
<td>
And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good. <tr>

And the evening and the morning were the fifth day. <tr>
