And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground. <tr>

And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD. <tr>

4:4</font>
<td>
And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering: <tr>

<font size=-1>
4:5</font>

But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell. <tr>

And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen? <tr>

If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him. <tr>

And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand; <tr>

When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth. <tr>

And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can bear. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:14</font>
<td>
Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me. <tr>
<td valign=top>

4:17</font>
<td>
And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch. <tr>
