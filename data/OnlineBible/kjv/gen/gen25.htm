But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country. <tr>

And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to Laban the Syrian. <tr>

And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she was barren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived. <tr>

25:22</font>
<td>
And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the LORD. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
25:23</font>
<td>
And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger. <tr>
<td valign=top>

And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
25:26</font>
<td>
And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
25:27</font>
<td>
And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
25:28</font>
<td>
And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob. <tr>
<td valign=top>

<td>
And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was faint: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
25:30</font>
<td>
And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
25:31</font>
<td>
And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
25:32</font>

And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me? <tr>

And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob. <tr>
