18:1</font>
<td>
And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:2</font>
<td>
And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:3</font>
<td>
And said, My LORD, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:4</font>
<td>
Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:5</font>
<td>
And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:6</font>
<td>
And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:7</font>
<td>
And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:8</font>
<td>
And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:9</font>
<td>
And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:10</font>
<td>
And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:11</font>
<td>
Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:12</font>
<td>
Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:13</font>
<td>
And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:14</font>
<td>
Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:15</font>
<td>
Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:16</font>
<td>
And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:17</font>
<td>
And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:18</font>
<td>
Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:19</font>
<td>
For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:20</font>
<td>
And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:21</font>
<td>
I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:22</font>
<td>
And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:23</font>
<td>
And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:24</font>
<td>
Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:25</font>
<td>
That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:26</font>
<td>
And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:27</font>
<td>
And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the LORD, which am but dust and ashes: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:28</font>
<td>
Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:29</font>
<td>
And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:30</font>
<td>
And he said unto him, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:31</font>
<td>
And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the LORD: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:32</font>
<td>
And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:33</font>
<td>
And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place. </table>
