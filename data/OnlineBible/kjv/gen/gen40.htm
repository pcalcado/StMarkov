And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
40:2</font>
<td>
And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
40:3</font>
<td>
And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
40:4</font>
<td>
And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them: and they continued a season in ward. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
40:5</font>
<td>
And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which were bound in the prison. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
40:6</font>
<td>
And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon them, and, behold, they were sad. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
40:7</font>
<td>
And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward of his lord's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to day? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
40:8</font>
<td>
And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
40:9</font>
<td>
And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
40:10</font>
<td>
And in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
40:11</font>
<td>
And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
40:12</font>
<td>
And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The three branches are three days: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
40:13</font>
<td>
Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
40:14</font>
<td>
But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
40:15</font>
<td>
For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
40:16</font>
<td>
When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three white baskets on my head: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
40:17</font>
<td>
And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
40:18</font>
<td>
And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: The three baskets are three days: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
40:19</font>
<td>
Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
40:20</font>
<td>
And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
40:21</font>
<td>
And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
40:22</font>
<td>
But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
40:23</font>
<td>
Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him. </table>
