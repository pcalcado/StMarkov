26:1</font>
<td>
And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:2</font>
<td>
And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:3</font>
<td>
Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:4</font>
<td>
And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:5</font>
<td>
Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:6</font>
<td>
And Isaac dwelt in Gerar: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:7</font>
<td>
And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she was fair to look upon. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:8</font>
<td>
And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:9</font>
<td>
And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy wife: and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:10</font>
<td>
And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:11</font>
<td>
And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:12</font>
<td>
Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:13</font>
<td>
And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:14</font>
<td>
For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:15</font>
<td>
For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:16</font>
<td>
And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:17</font>
<td>
And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:18</font>
<td>
And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:19</font>
<td>
And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:20</font>
<td>
And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:21</font>
<td>
And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:22</font>
<td>
And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:23</font>
<td>
And he went up from thence to Beersheba. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:24</font>
<td>
And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:25</font>
<td>
And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants digged a well. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:26</font>
<td>
Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:27</font>
<td>
And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:28</font>
<td>
And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:29</font>
<td>
That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:30</font>
<td>
And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:31</font>
<td>
And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:32</font>
<td>
And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:33</font>
<td>
And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is Beersheba unto this day. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:34</font>
<td>
And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite: <tr>

Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah. </table>
