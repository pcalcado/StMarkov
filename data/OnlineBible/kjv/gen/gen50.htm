And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel. <tr>

And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days. <tr>

And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying, <tr>

My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again. <tr>

And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt, <tr>

And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen. <tr>

And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company. <tr>

And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
50:11</font>

And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim, which is beyond Jordan. <tr>

And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
50:13</font>

For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre. <tr>

And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
50:16</font>
<td>
And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
50:17</font>
<td>
So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
50:18</font>

And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we be thy servants. <tr>

And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
50:20</font>
<td>
But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive. <tr>
<td valign=top>

Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them. <tr>

And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence. <tr>
