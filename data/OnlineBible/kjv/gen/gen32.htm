32:1</font>
<td>
And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
32:2</font>
<td>
And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
32:3</font>
<td>
And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
32:4</font>
<td>
And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
32:5</font>
<td>
And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
32:6</font>
<td>
And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
32:7</font>
<td>
Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
32:8</font>
<td>
And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
32:9</font>
<td>
And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
32:10</font>
<td>
I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
32:11</font>
<td>
Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the mother with the children. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
32:12</font>
<td>
And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
32:13</font>
<td>
And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
32:14</font>
<td>
Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
32:15</font>
<td>
Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
32:16</font>
<td>
And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
32:17</font>
<td>
And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
32:18</font>
<td>
Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is behind us. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
32:19</font>
<td>
And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
32:20</font>
<td>
And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
32:21</font>
<td>
So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
32:22</font>
<td>
And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
32:23</font>
<td>
And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
32:24</font>
<td>
And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
32:25</font>
<td>
And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
32:26</font>
<td>
And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
32:27</font>
<td>
And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
32:28</font>
<td>
And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
32:29</font>
<td>
And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
32:30</font>
<td>
And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
32:31</font>
<td>
And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
32:32</font>
<td>
Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank. </table>
