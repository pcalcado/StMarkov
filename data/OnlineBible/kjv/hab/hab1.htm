1:1</font>
<td>
The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:2</font>
<td>
O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! even cry out unto thee of violence, and thou wilt not save! <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:3</font>
<td>
Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause me to behold grievance? for spoiling and violence are before me: and there are that raise up strife and contention. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:4</font>
<td>
Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore wrong judgment proceedeth. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:5</font>
<td>
Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvellously: for I will work a work in your days, which ye will not believe, though it be told you. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:6</font>
<td>
For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwellingplaces that are not theirs. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:7</font>
<td>
They are terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:8</font>
<td>
Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle that hasteth to eat. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:9</font>
<td>
They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up as the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the sand. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:10</font>
<td>
And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn unto them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall heap dust, and take it. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:11</font>
<td>
Then shall his mind change, and he shall pass over, and offend, imputing this his power unto his god. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:12</font>
<td>
Art thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, mine Holy One? we shall not die. O LORD, thou hast ordained them for judgment; and, O mighty God, thou hast established them for correction. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:13</font>
<td>
Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, and holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous than he? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:14</font>
<td>
And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, that have no ruler over them? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:15</font>
<td>
They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their net, and gather them in their drag: therefore they rejoice and are glad. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:16</font>
<td>
Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto their drag; because by them their portion is fat, and their meat plenteous. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:17</font>
<td>
Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay the nations? </table>
