The sun and moon stood still in their habitation: at the light of thine arrows they went, and at the shining of thy glittering spear. <tr>

Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, even for salvation with thine anointed; thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked, by discovering the foundation unto the neck. Selah. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:14</font>

<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>

Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls: <tr>
