7:1</font>
<td>
Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me; and, behold, he formed grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and, lo, it was the latter growth after the king's mowings. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:2</font>
<td>
And it came to pass, that when they had made an end of eating the grass of the land, then I said, O Lord GOD, forgive, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he is small. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:3</font>
<td>
The LORD repented for this: It shall not be, saith the LORD. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:4</font>
<td>
Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me: and, behold, the Lord GOD called to contend by fire, and it devoured the great deep, and did eat up a part. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:5</font>
<td>
Then said I, O Lord GOD, cease, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he is small. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:6</font>
<td>
The LORD repented for this: This also shall not be, saith the Lord GOD. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:7</font>
<td>
Thus he shewed me: and, behold, the LORD stood upon a wall made by a plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:8</font>
<td>
And the LORD said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A plumbline. Then said the LORD, Behold, I will set a plumbline in the midst of my people Israel: I will not again pass by them any more: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:9</font>
<td>
And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:10</font>
<td>
Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:11</font>
<td>
For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:12</font>
<td>
Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thee away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:13</font>
<td>
But prophesy not again any more at Bethel: for it is the king's chapel, and it is the king's court. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:14</font>
<td>
Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet's son; but I was an herdman, and a gatherer of sycomore fruit: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:15</font>
<td>
And the LORD took me as I followed the flock, and the LORD said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:16</font>
<td>
Now therefore hear thou the word of the LORD: Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not thy word against the house of Isaac. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:17</font>
<td>
Therefore thus saith the LORD; Thy wife shall be an harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou shalt die in a polluted land: and Israel shall surely go into captivity forth of his land. </table>
