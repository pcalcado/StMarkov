Hear ye this word which I take up against you, even a lamentation, O house of Israel. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:2</font>
<td>
The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise: she is forsaken upon her land; there is none to raise her up. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:3</font>
<td>
For thus saith the Lord GOD; The city that went out by a thousand shall leave an hundred, and that which went forth by an hundred shall leave ten, to the house of Israel. <tr>

For thus saith the LORD unto the house of Israel, Seek ye me, and ye shall live: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:5</font>
<td>
But seek not Bethel, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beersheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Bethel shall come to nought. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:6</font>
<td>
Seek the LORD, and ye shall live; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and devour it, and there be none to quench it in Bethel. <tr>

<font size=-1>
5:7</font>
<td>
Ye who turn judgment to wormwood, and leave off righteousness in the earth, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:8</font>
<td>
Seek him that maketh the seven stars and Orion, and turneth the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark with night: that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The LORD is his name: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:9</font>
<td>
That strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong, so that the spoiled shall come against the fortress. <tr>
<td valign=top>

5:10</font>
<td>
They hate him that rebuketh in the gate, and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:11</font>
<td>
Forasmuch therefore as your treading is upon the poor, and ye take from him burdens of wheat: ye have built houses of hewn stone, but ye shall not dwell in them; ye have planted pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not drink wine of them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:12</font>
<td>
For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins: they afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside the poor in the gate from their right. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:13</font>
<td>
Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time; for it is an evil time. <tr>
<td valign=top>

Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live: and so the LORD, the God of hosts, shall be with you, as ye have spoken. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:15</font>
<td>
Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgment in the gate: it may be that the LORD God of hosts will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:16</font>
<td>
Therefore the LORD, the God of hosts, the LORD, saith thus; Wailing shall be in all streets; and they shall say in all the highways, Alas! alas! and they shall call the husbandman to mourning, and such as are skilful of lamentation to wailing. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:17</font>
<td>
And in all vineyards shall be wailing: for I will pass through thee, saith the LORD. <tr>

Woe unto you that desire the day of the LORD! to what end is it for you? the day of the LORD is darkness, and not light. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:19</font>
<td>
As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:20</font>
<td>
Shall not the day of the LORD be darkness, and not light? even very dark, and no brightness in it? <tr>

I hate, I despise your feast days, and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies. <tr>
<td valign=top>

5:22</font>
<td>
Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I will not accept them: neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts. <tr>

5:23</font>
<td>
Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody of thy viols. <tr>

Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:26</font>
