12:1</font>
<td>
I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:2</font>
<td>
And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:3</font>
<td>
For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:4</font>
<td>
For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:5</font>
<td>
So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:6</font>
<td>
Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:7</font>
<td>
Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:8</font>
<td>
Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:9</font>
<td>
Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:10</font>
<td>
Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:11</font>
<td>
Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:12</font>
<td>
Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:13</font>
<td>
Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:14</font>
<td>
Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:15</font>
<td>
Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:16</font>
<td>
Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:17</font>
<td>
Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:18</font>
<td>
If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:19</font>
<td>
Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:20</font>
<td>
Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:21</font>
<td>
Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good. </table>
