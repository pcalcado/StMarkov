Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:2</font>
<td>
(Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,) <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:3</font>
<td>
Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:4</font>
<td>
And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:5</font>
<td>
By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:6</font>
<td>
Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:7</font>
<td>
To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:8</font>
<td>
First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:9</font>
<td>
For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:10</font>
<td>
Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:11</font>
<td>
For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:12</font>
<td>
That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:13</font>
<td>
Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:14</font>
<td>
I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:15</font>
<td>
So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:16</font>
<td>
For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:17</font>
<td>
For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:18</font>
<td>
For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:19</font>
<td>
Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:20</font>
<td>
For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:21</font>
<td>
Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:22</font>
<td>
Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:23</font>
<td>
And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:24</font>
<td>
Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:25</font>
<td>
Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:26</font>
<td>
For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:27</font>
<td>
And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:28</font>
<td>
And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:29</font>
<td>
Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:30</font>
<td>
Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:31</font>
<td>
Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:32</font>
<td>
Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them. </table>
