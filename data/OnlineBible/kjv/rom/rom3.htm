3:1</font>
<td>
What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:2</font>
<td>
Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:3</font>
<td>
For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:4</font>
<td>
God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:5</font>
<td>
But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man) <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:6</font>
<td>
God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:7</font>
<td>
For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:8</font>
<td>
And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:9</font>
<td>
What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:10</font>
<td>
As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:11</font>
<td>
There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:12</font>
<td>
They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:13</font>
<td>
Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:14</font>
<td>
Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:15</font>
<td>
Their feet are swift to shed blood: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:16</font>
<td>
Destruction and misery are in their ways: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:17</font>
<td>
And the way of peace have they not known: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:18</font>
<td>
There is no fear of God before their eyes. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:19</font>
<td>
Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:20</font>
<td>
Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:21</font>
<td>
But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:22</font>
<td>
Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:23</font>
<td>
For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:24</font>
<td>
Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:25</font>
<td>
Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:26</font>
<td>
To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:27</font>
<td>
Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:28</font>
<td>
Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:29</font>
<td>
Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:30</font>
<td>
Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:31</font>
<td>
Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law. </table>
