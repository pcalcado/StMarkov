6:1</font>
<td>
What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:2</font>
<td>
God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:3</font>
<td>
Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:4</font>
<td>
Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:5</font>
<td>
For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:6</font>
<td>
Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:7</font>
<td>
For he that is dead is freed from sin. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:8</font>
<td>
Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:9</font>
<td>
Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:10</font>
<td>
For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:11</font>
<td>
Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:12</font>
<td>
Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:13</font>
<td>
Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:14</font>
<td>
For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:15</font>
<td>
What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:16</font>
<td>
Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:17</font>
<td>
But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:18</font>
<td>
Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:19</font>
<td>
I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:20</font>
<td>
For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:21</font>
<td>
What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:22</font>
<td>
But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:23</font>
<td>
For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. </table>
