4:1</font>
<td>
What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:2</font>
<td>
For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not before God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:3</font>
<td>
For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:4</font>
<td>
Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:5</font>
<td>
But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:6</font>
<td>
Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:7</font>
<td>
Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:8</font>
<td>
Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:9</font>
<td>
Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:10</font>
<td>
How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:11</font>
<td>
And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:12</font>
<td>
And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:13</font>
<td>
For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:14</font>
<td>
For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:15</font>
<td>
Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:16</font>
<td>
Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:17</font>
<td>
(As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:18</font>
<td>
Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:19</font>
<td>
And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:20</font>
<td>
He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:21</font>
<td>
And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:22</font>
<td>
And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:23</font>
<td>
Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:24</font>
<td>
But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:25</font>
<td>
Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification. </table>
