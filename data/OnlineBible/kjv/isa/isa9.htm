Thou hast multiplied the nation, and not increased the joy: they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest, and as men rejoice when they divide the spoil. <tr>

For every battle of the warrior is with confused noise, and garments rolled in blood; but this shall be with burning and fuel of fire. <tr>

<font size=-1>
9:7</font>

Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will perform this. <tr>
