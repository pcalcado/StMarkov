I am sought of them that asked not for me; I am found of them that sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a nation that was not called by my name. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
65:2</font>
<td>
I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people, which walketh in a way that was not good, after their own thoughts; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
65:3</font>
<td>
A people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face; that sacrificeth in gardens, and burneth incense upon altars of brick; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
65:4</font>
<td>
Which remain among the graves, and lodge in the monuments, which eat swine's flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
65:5</font>
<td>
Which say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me; for I am holier than thou. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the day. <tr>

65:6</font>

Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence, but will recompense, even recompense into their bosom, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
65:7</font>
<td>
Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith the LORD, which have burned incense upon the mountains, and blasphemed me upon the hills: therefore will I measure their former work into their bosom. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
65:8</font>
<td>
Thus saith the LORD, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one saith, Destroy it not; for a blessing is in it: so will I do for my servants' sakes, that I may not destroy them all. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
65:9</font>
<td>
And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains: and mine elect shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
65:10</font>
<td>
And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for the herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
65:11</font>
<td>
But ye are they that forsake the LORD, that forget my holy mountain, that prepare a table for that troop, and that furnish the drink offering unto that number. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
65:12</font>
<td>
Therefore will I number you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter: because when I called, ye did not answer; when I spake, ye did not hear; but did evil before mine eyes, and did choose that wherein I delighted not. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
65:13</font>
<td>
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty: behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
65:14</font>
<td>
Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation of spirit. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
65:15</font>
<td>
And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen: for the Lord GOD shall slay thee, and call his servants by another name: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
65:16</font>
<td>
That he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
65:17</font>
<td>
For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
65:18</font>
<td>
But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create: for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
65:19</font>
<td>
And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people: and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
65:20</font>
<td>
There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days: for the child shall die an hundred years old; but the sinner being an hundred years old shall be accursed. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
65:21</font>
<td>
And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
65:22</font>
<td>
They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
65:23</font>
<td>
They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for they are the seed of the blessed of the LORD, and their offspring with them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
65:24</font>
<td>
And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
65:25</font>
<td>
The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock: and dust shall be the serpent's meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the LORD. </table>
