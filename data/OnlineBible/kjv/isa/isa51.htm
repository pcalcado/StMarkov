Hearken to me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that seek the LORD: look unto the rock whence ye are hewn, and to the hole of the pit whence ye are digged. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
51:2</font>

Look unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah that bare you: for I called him alone, and blessed him, and increased him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
51:3</font>
<td>
For the LORD shall comfort Zion: he will comfort all her waste places; and he will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the LORD; joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
51:4</font>
<td>
Hearken unto me, my people; and give ear unto me, O my nation: for a law shall proceed from me, and I will make my judgment to rest for a light of the people. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
51:5</font>
<td>
My righteousness is near; my salvation is gone forth, and mine arms shall judge the people; the isles shall wait upon me, and on mine arm shall they trust. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
51:6</font>
<td>
Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath: for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment, and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner: but my salvation shall be for ever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
51:7</font>

Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in whose heart is my law; fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of their revilings. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
51:8</font>
<td>
For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool: but my righteousness shall be for ever, and my salvation from generation to generation. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
51:9</font>
<td>
Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the LORD; awake, as in the ancient days, in the generations of old. Art thou not it that hath cut Rahab, and wounded the dragon? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
51:10</font>
<td>
Art thou not it which hath dried the sea, the waters of the great deep; that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass over? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
51:11</font>
<td>
Therefore the redeemed of the LORD shall return, and come with singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy shall be upon their head: they shall obtain gladness and joy; and sorrow and mourning shall flee away. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
51:12</font>

I, even I, am he that comforteth you: who art thou, that thou shouldest be afraid of a man that shall die, and of the son of man which shall be made as grass; <tr>

And forgettest the LORD thy maker, that hath stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and hast feared continually every day because of the fury of the oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy? and where is the fury of the oppressor? <tr>

The captive exile hasteneth that he may be loosed, and that he should not die in the pit, nor that his bread should fail. <tr>

51:15</font>
<td>
But I am the LORD thy God, that divided the sea, whose waves roared: The LORD of hosts is his name. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
51:16</font>
<td>
And I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou art my people. <tr>
<td valign=top>

51:17</font>

Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast drunk at the hand of the LORD the cup of his fury; thou hast drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling, and wrung them out. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
51:18</font>
<td>
There is none to guide her among all the sons whom she hath brought forth; neither is there any that taketh her by the hand of all the sons that she hath brought up. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
51:19</font>
<td>
These two things are come unto thee; who shall be sorry for thee? desolation, and destruction, and the famine, and the sword: by whom shall I comfort thee? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
51:20</font>

Thy sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets, as a wild bull in a net: they are full of the fury of the LORD, the rebuke of thy God. <tr>

Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, but not with wine: <tr>

51:22</font>
<td>
Thus saith thy Lord the LORD, and thy God that pleadeth the cause of his people, Behold, I have taken out of thine hand the cup of trembling, even the dregs of the cup of my fury; thou shalt no more drink it again: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
51:23</font>

But I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee; which have said to thy soul, Bow down, that we may go over: and thou hast laid thy body as the ground, and as the street, to them that went over. </table>
