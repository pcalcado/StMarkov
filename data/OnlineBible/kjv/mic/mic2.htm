<td>
Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks; neither shall ye go haughtily: for this time is evil. <tr>

2:4</font>
<td>
In that day shall one take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, and say, We be utterly spoiled: he hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he removed it from me! turning away he hath divided our fields. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>

O thou that art named the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the LORD straitened? are these his doings? do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:8</font>

Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from war. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>

The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever. <tr>

2:12</font>
<td>
I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold: they shall make great noise by reason of the multitude of men. <tr>

The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and have passed through the gate, and are gone out by it: and their king shall pass before them, and the LORD on the head of them. </table>
