1:1</font>
<td>
Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:2</font>
<td>
It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:3</font>
<td>
And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:4</font>
<td>
And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:5</font>
<td>
And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:6</font>
<td>
And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:7</font>
<td>
And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:8</font>
<td>
And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:9</font>
<td>
He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole in me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:10</font>
<td>
So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:11</font>
<td>
Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:12</font>
<td>
And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:13</font>
<td>
And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:14</font>
<td>
And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the LORD's anointed? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:15</font>
<td>
And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he smote him that he died. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:16</font>
<td>
And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD's anointed. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:17</font>
<td>
And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:18</font>
<td>
(Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.) <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:19</font>
<td>
The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen! <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:20</font>
<td>
Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:21</font>
<td>
Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:22</font>
<td>
From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:23</font>
<td>
Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:24</font>
<td>
Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:25</font>
<td>
How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, thou wast slain in thine high places. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:26</font>
<td>
I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:27</font>
<td>
How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished! </table>
