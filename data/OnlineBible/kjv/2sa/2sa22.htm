22:1</font>
<td>
And David spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day that the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:2</font>
<td>
And he said, The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:3</font>
<td>
The God of my rock; in him will I trust: he is my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour; thou savest me from violence. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:4</font>
<td>
I will call on the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:5</font>
<td>
When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly men made me afraid; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:6</font>
<td>
The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death prevented me; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:7</font>
<td>
In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God: and he did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry did enter into his ears. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:8</font>
<td>
Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he was wroth. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:9</font>
<td>
There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:10</font>
<td>
He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was under his feet. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:11</font>
<td>
And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon the wings of the wind. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:12</font>
<td>
And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters, and thick clouds of the skies. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:13</font>
<td>
Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:14</font>
<td>
The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his voice. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:15</font>
<td>
And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and discomfited them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:16</font>
<td>
And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world were discovered, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:17</font>
<td>
He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:18</font>
<td>
He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them that hated me: for they were too strong for me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:19</font>
<td>
They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:20</font>
<td>
He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me, because he delighted in me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:21</font>
<td>
The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness: according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:22</font>
<td>
For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:23</font>
<td>
For all his judgments were before me: and as for his statutes, I did not depart from them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:24</font>
<td>
I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine iniquity. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:25</font>
<td>
Therefore the LORD hath recompensed me according to my righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye sight. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:26</font>
<td>
With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful, and with the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:27</font>
<td>
With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:28</font>
<td>
And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but thine eyes are upon the haughty, that thou mayest bring them down. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:29</font>
<td>
For thou art my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my darkness. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:30</font>
<td>
For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I leaped over a wall. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:31</font>
<td>
As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all them that trust in him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:32</font>
<td>
For who is God, save the LORD? and who is a rock, save our God? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:33</font>
<td>
God is my strength and power: and he maketh my way perfect. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:34</font>
<td>
He maketh my feet like hinds' feet: and setteth me upon my high places. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:35</font>
<td>
He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:36</font>
<td>
Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy gentleness hath made me great. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:37</font>
<td>
Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not slip. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:38</font>
<td>
I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not again until I had consumed them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:39</font>
<td>
And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:40</font>
<td>
For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:41</font>
<td>
Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:42</font>
<td>
They looked, but there was none to save; even unto the LORD, but he answered them not. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:43</font>
<td>
Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp them as the mire of the street, and did spread them abroad. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:44</font>
<td>
Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people, thou hast kept me to be head of the heathen: a people which I knew not shall serve me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:45</font>
<td>
Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they hear, they shall be obedient unto me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:46</font>
<td>
Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their close places. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:47</font>
<td>
The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:48</font>
<td>
It is God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people under me, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:49</font>
<td>
And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:50</font>
<td>
Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and I will sing praises unto thy name. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:51</font>
<td>
He is the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth mercy to his anointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore. </table>
