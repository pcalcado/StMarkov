<td>
Now these be the last words of David. David the son of Jesse said, and the man who was raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:2</font>

The Spirit of the LORD spake by me, and his word was in my tongue. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:3</font>
<td>
The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:4</font>

And he shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, even a morning without clouds; as the tender grass springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:5</font>

Although my house be not so with God; yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure: for this is all my salvation, and all my desire, although he make it not to grow. <tr>

23:7</font>
<td>
But the man that shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the same place. <tr>

<font size=-1>
23:8</font>
<td>
These be the names of the mighty men whom David had: The Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite: he lift up his spear against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:9</font>
<td>
And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines that were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:10</font>
<td>
He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clave unto the sword: and the LORD wrought a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to spoil. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:11</font>

And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a piece of ground full of lentiles: and the people fled from the Philistines. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:12</font>

But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and slew the Philistines: and the LORD wrought a great victory. <tr>

And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam: and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim. <tr>

And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate! <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:16</font>
<td>
And the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: nevertheless he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto the LORD. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:17</font>
<td>
And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this: is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives? therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mighty men. <tr>
