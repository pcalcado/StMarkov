<td>
The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came to pass in the month Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:2</font>
<td>
That Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, which were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:3</font>
<td>
And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:4</font>
<td>
And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:5</font>
<td>
And said, I beseech thee, O LORD God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:6</font>
<td>
Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father's house have sinned. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:7</font>
<td>
We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which thou commandedst thy servant Moses. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:8</font>
<td>
Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying, If ye transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the nations: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:9</font>
<td>
But if ye turn unto me, and keep my commandments, and do them; though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:10</font>
<td>
Now these are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:11</font>
<td>
O LORD, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who desire to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I was the king's cupbearer. </table>
