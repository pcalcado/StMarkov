Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; <tr>

Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:6</font>

Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time: <tr>

Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you. <tr>

Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world. <tr>

But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you. <tr>

By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand. <tr>

The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, saluteth you; and so doth Marcus my son. <tr>
