When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom, <tr>

And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now. <tr>

This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him. <tr>

After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days. <tr>

And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting: <tr>

And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables; <tr>
