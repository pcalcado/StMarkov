5:1</font>
<td>
After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:2</font>
<td>
Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:3</font>
<td>
In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:4</font>
<td>
For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:5</font>
<td>
And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:6</font>
<td>
When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:7</font>
<td>
The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:8</font>
<td>
Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:9</font>
<td>
And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:10</font>
<td>
The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:11</font>
<td>
He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:12</font>
<td>
Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:13</font>
<td>
And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:14</font>
<td>
Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:15</font>
<td>
The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:16</font>
<td>
And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:17</font>
<td>
But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:18</font>
<td>
Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:19</font>
<td>
Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:20</font>
<td>
For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:21</font>
<td>
For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:22</font>
<td>
For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:23</font>
<td>
That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:24</font>
<td>
Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:25</font>
<td>
Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:26</font>
<td>
For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:27</font>
<td>
And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:28</font>
<td>
Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:29</font>
<td>
And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:30</font>
<td>
I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:31</font>
<td>
If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:32</font>
<td>
There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:33</font>
<td>
Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:34</font>
<td>
But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:35</font>
<td>
He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:36</font>
<td>
But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:37</font>
<td>
And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:38</font>
<td>
And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:39</font>
<td>
Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:40</font>
<td>
And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:41</font>
<td>
I receive not honour from men. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:42</font>
<td>
But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:43</font>
<td>
I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:44</font>
<td>
How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from God only? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:45</font>
<td>
Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:46</font>
<td>
For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:47</font>
<td>
But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words? </table>
