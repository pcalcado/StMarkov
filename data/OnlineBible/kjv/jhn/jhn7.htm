7:1</font>
<td>
After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:2</font>
<td>
Now the Jews' feast of tabernacles was at hand. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:3</font>
<td>
His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:4</font>
<td>
For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:5</font>
<td>
For neither did his brethren believe in him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:6</font>
<td>
Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:7</font>
<td>
The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:8</font>
<td>
Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast: for my time is not yet full come. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:9</font>
<td>
When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in Galilee. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:10</font>
<td>
But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:11</font>
<td>
Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:12</font>
<td>
And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:13</font>
<td>
Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:14</font>
<td>
Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:15</font>
<td>
And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:16</font>
<td>
Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:17</font>
<td>
If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:18</font>
<td>
He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:19</font>
<td>
Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:20</font>
<td>
The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:21</font>
<td>
Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:22</font>
<td>
Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:23</font>
<td>
If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:24</font>
<td>
Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:25</font>
<td>
Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:26</font>
<td>
But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:27</font>
<td>
Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:28</font>
<td>
Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:29</font>
<td>
But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:30</font>
<td>
Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:31</font>
<td>
And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:32</font>
<td>
The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:33</font>
<td>
Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto him that sent me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:34</font>
<td>
Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:35</font>
<td>
Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:36</font>
<td>
What manner of saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:37</font>
<td>
In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:38</font>
<td>
He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:39</font>
<td>
(But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.) <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:40</font>
<td>
Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:41</font>
<td>
Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:42</font>
<td>
Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:43</font>
<td>
So there was a division among the people because of him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:44</font>
<td>
And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:45</font>
<td>
Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:46</font>
<td>
The officers answered, Never man spake like this man. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:47</font>
<td>
Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:48</font>
<td>
Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:49</font>
<td>
But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:50</font>
<td>
Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,) <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:51</font>
<td>
Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:52</font>
<td>
They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:53</font>
<td>
And every man went unto his own house. </table>
