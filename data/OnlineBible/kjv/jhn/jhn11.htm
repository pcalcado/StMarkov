11:1</font>
<td>
Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:2</font>
<td>
(It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.) <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:3</font>
<td>
Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:4</font>
<td>
When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:5</font>
<td>
Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:6</font>
<td>
When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:7</font>
<td>
Then after that saith he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea again. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:8</font>
<td>
His disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone thee; and goest thou thither again? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:9</font>
<td>
Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:10</font>
<td>
But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:11</font>
<td>
These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:12</font>
<td>
Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:13</font>
<td>
Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:14</font>
<td>
Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:15</font>
<td>
And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:16</font>
<td>
Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:17</font>
<td>
Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:18</font>
<td>
Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:19</font>
<td>
And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:20</font>
<td>
Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat still in the house. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:21</font>
<td>
Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:22</font>
<td>
But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:23</font>
<td>
Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:24</font>
<td>
Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:25</font>
<td>
Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:26</font>
<td>
And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:27</font>
<td>
She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:28</font>
<td>
And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:29</font>
<td>
As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:30</font>
<td>
Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:31</font>
<td>
The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:32</font>
<td>
Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:33</font>
<td>
When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:34</font>
<td>
And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come and see. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:35</font>
<td>
Jesus wept. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:36</font>
<td>
Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him! <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:37</font>
<td>
And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:38</font>
<td>
Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:39</font>
<td>
Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead four days. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:40</font>
<td>
Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:41</font>
<td>
Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:42</font>
<td>
And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:43</font>
<td>
And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:44</font>
<td>
And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:45</font>
<td>
Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:46</font>
<td>
But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:47</font>
<td>
Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:48</font>
<td>
If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:49</font>
<td>
And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:50</font>
<td>
Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:51</font>
<td>
And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:52</font>
<td>
And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:53</font>
<td>
Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:54</font>
<td>
Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:55</font>
<td>
And the Jews' passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:56</font>
<td>
Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:57</font>
<td>
Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew it, that they might take him. </table>
