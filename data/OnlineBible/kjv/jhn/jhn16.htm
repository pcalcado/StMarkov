16:1</font>
<td>
These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:2</font>
<td>
They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:3</font>
<td>
And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:4</font>
<td>
But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I told you of them. And these things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:5</font>
<td>
But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:6</font>
<td>
But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:7</font>
<td>
Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:8</font>
<td>
And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:9</font>
<td>
Of sin, because they believe not on me; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:10</font>
<td>
Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:11</font>
<td>
Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:12</font>
<td>
I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:13</font>
<td>
Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:14</font>
<td>
He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:15</font>
<td>
All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:16</font>
<td>
A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:17</font>
<td>
Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:18</font>
<td>
They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? we cannot tell what he saith. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:19</font>
<td>
Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:20</font>
<td>
Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:21</font>
<td>
A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:22</font>
<td>
And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:23</font>
<td>
And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:24</font>
<td>
Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:25</font>
<td>
These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:26</font>
<td>
At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:27</font>
<td>
For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:28</font>
<td>
I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:29</font>
<td>
His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:30</font>
<td>
Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:31</font>
<td>
Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:32</font>
<td>
Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:33</font>
<td>
These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world. </table>
