9:1</font>
<td>
And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:2</font>
<td>
And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:3</font>
<td>
Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:4</font>
<td>
I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:5</font>
<td>
As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:6</font>
<td>
When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:7</font>
<td>
And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:8</font>
<td>
The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:9</font>
<td>
Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I am he. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:10</font>
<td>
Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:11</font>
<td>
He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:12</font>
<td>
Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:13</font>
<td>
They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:14</font>
<td>
And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:15</font>
<td>
Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:16</font>
<td>
Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:17</font>
<td>
They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:18</font>
<td>
But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:19</font>
<td>
And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:20</font>
<td>
His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:21</font>
<td>
But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:22</font>
<td>
These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:23</font>
<td>
Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:24</font>
<td>
Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:25</font>
<td>
He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:26</font>
<td>
Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:27</font>
<td>
He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:28</font>
<td>
Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses' disciples. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:29</font>
<td>
We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow, we know not from whence he is. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:30</font>
<td>
The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:31</font>
<td>
Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:32</font>
<td>
Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:33</font>
<td>
If this man were not of God, he could do nothing. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:34</font>
<td>
They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:35</font>
<td>
Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:36</font>
<td>
He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:37</font>
<td>
And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:38</font>
<td>
And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:39</font>
<td>
And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:40</font>
<td>
And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:41</font>
<td>
Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth. </table>
