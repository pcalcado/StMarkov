10:1</font>
<td>
Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:2</font>

But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:3</font>
<td>
To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:4</font>
<td>
And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:5</font>
<td>
And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:6</font>
<td>
This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:7</font>
<td>
Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:8</font>
<td>
All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:9</font>
<td>
I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:10</font>
<td>
The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:11</font>
<td>
I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:12</font>
<td>
But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:13</font>
<td>
The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:14</font>
<td>
I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:15</font>
<td>
As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:16</font>
<td>
And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:17</font>
<td>
Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:18</font>
<td>
No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:19</font>
<td>
There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:20</font>
<td>
And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:21</font>
<td>
Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:22</font>
<td>
And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:23</font>
<td>
And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:24</font>
<td>
Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:25</font>
<td>
Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:26</font>
<td>
But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:27</font>
<td>
My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:28</font>
<td>
And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:29</font>
<td>
My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:30</font>
<td>
I and my Father are one. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:31</font>
<td>
Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:32</font>
<td>
Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:33</font>
<td>
The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:34</font>
<td>
Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:35</font>
<td>
If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:36</font>
<td>
Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:37</font>
<td>
If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:38</font>
<td>
But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:39</font>
<td>
Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:40</font>
<td>
And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:41</font>
<td>
And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spake of this man were true. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:42</font>
<td>
And many believed on him there. </table>
