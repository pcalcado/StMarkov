4:1</font>
<td>
When therefore the LORD knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:2</font>
<td>
(Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,) <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:3</font>
<td>
He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:4</font>
<td>
And he must needs go through Samaria. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:5</font>
<td>
Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:6</font>
<td>
Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:7</font>
<td>
There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:8</font>
<td>
(For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.) <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:9</font>
<td>
Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:10</font>
<td>
Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:11</font>
<td>
The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:12</font>
<td>
Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:13</font>
<td>
Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:14</font>
<td>
But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:15</font>
<td>
The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:16</font>
<td>
Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:17</font>
<td>
The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:18</font>
<td>
For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:19</font>
<td>
The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:20</font>
<td>
Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:21</font>
<td>
Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:22</font>
<td>
Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:23</font>
<td>
But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:24</font>
<td>
God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:25</font>
<td>
The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:26</font>
<td>
Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:27</font>
<td>
And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:28</font>
<td>
The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:29</font>
<td>
Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:30</font>
<td>
Then they went out of the city, and came unto him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:31</font>
<td>
In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:32</font>
<td>
But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:33</font>
<td>
Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him ought to eat? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:34</font>
<td>
Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:35</font>
<td>
Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:36</font>
<td>
And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:37</font>
<td>
And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:38</font>
<td>
I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:39</font>
<td>
And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:40</font>
<td>
So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:41</font>
<td>
And many more believed because of his own word; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:42</font>
<td>
And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:43</font>
<td>
Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:44</font>
<td>
For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:45</font>
<td>
Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:46</font>
<td>
So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:47</font>
<td>
When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:48</font>
<td>
Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:49</font>
<td>
The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:50</font>
<td>
Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:51</font>
<td>
And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Thy son liveth. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:52</font>
<td>
Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:53</font>
<td>
So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:54</font>
<td>
This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee. </table>
