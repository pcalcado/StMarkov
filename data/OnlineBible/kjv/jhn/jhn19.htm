19:1</font>
<td>
Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
19:2</font>
<td>
And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple robe, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
19:3</font>
<td>
And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote him with their hands. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
19:4</font>
<td>
Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
19:5</font>
<td>
Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate saith unto them, Behold the man! <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
19:6</font>
<td>
When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Take ye him, and crucify him: for I find no fault in him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
19:7</font>
<td>
The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
19:8</font>
<td>
When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
19:9</font>
<td>
And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
19:10</font>
<td>
Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
19:11</font>
<td>
Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
19:12</font>
<td>
And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar's friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
19:13</font>
<td>
When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
19:14</font>
<td>
And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your King! <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
19:15</font>
<td>
But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
19:16</font>
<td>
Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
19:17</font>
<td>
And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
19:18</font>
<td>
Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
19:19</font>
<td>
And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
19:20</font>
<td>
This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
19:21</font>
<td>
Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
19:22</font>
<td>
Pilate answered, What I have written I have written. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
19:23</font>
<td>
Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
19:24</font>
<td>
They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
19:25</font>
<td>
Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
19:26</font>
<td>
When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son! <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
19:27</font>
<td>
Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
19:28</font>
<td>
After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
19:29</font>
<td>
Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a spunge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
19:30</font>
<td>
When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
19:31</font>
<td>
The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
19:32</font>
<td>
Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
19:33</font>
<td>
But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
19:34</font>
<td>
But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
19:35</font>
<td>
And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
19:36</font>
<td>
For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
19:37</font>
<td>
And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
19:38</font>
<td>
And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
19:39</font>
<td>
And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
19:40</font>
<td>
Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
19:41</font>
<td>
Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
19:42</font>
<td>
There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews' preparation day; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand. </table>
