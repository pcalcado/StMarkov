I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:2</font>
<td>
Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:3</font>
<td>
Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:4</font>
<td>
Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:5</font>
<td>
I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:6</font>
<td>
If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:7</font>
<td>
If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:8</font>
<td>
Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples. <tr>
<td valign=top>

15:9</font>
<td>
As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:10</font>
<td>
If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:11</font>
<td>
These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:12</font>
<td>
This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:13</font>
<td>
Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:14</font>
<td>
Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:15</font>
<td>
Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:16</font>
<td>
Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:17</font>

These things I command you, that ye love one another. <tr>
<td valign=top>

15:18</font>
<td>
If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:19</font>
<td>
If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:20</font>
<td>
Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:21</font>
<td>
But all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:22</font>
<td>
If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloak for their sin. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:23</font>
<td>
He that hateth me hateth my Father also. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:24</font>
<td>
If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:25</font>
<td>
But this cometh to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:26</font>
<td>
But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me: <tr>
<td valign=top>

15:27</font>
<td>
And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning. </table>
