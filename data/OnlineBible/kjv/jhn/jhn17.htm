<td>
These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
17:2</font>
<td>
As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
17:3</font>
<td>
And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
17:4</font>
<td>
I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
17:5</font>
<td>
And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
17:6</font>
<td>
I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thy word. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
17:7</font>
<td>
Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
17:8</font>
<td>
For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received them, and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
17:9</font>
<td>
I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
17:10</font>
<td>
And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
17:11</font>
<td>
And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
17:12</font>
<td>
While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
17:13</font>
<td>
And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
17:14</font>
<td>
I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
17:15</font>
<td>
I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
17:16</font>
<td>
They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
17:17</font>
<td>
Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
17:18</font>
<td>
As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
17:19</font>
<td>
And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
17:20</font>
<td>
Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
17:21</font>
<td>
That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
17:22</font>
<td>
And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
17:23</font>
<td>
I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
17:24</font>
<td>
Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
17:25</font>
<td>
O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
17:26</font>
<td>
And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them. </table>
