<td>
Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:2</font>
<td>
There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:3</font>
<td>
Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:4</font>
<td>
Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, which should betray him, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:5</font>
<td>
Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:6</font>
<td>
This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:7</font>
<td>
Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:8</font>
<td>
For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:9</font>
<td>
Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:10</font>
<td>
But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:11</font>
<td>
Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:12</font>
<td>
On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:13</font>
<td>
Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:14</font>
<td>
And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:15</font>
<td>
Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:16</font>
<td>
These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:17</font>
<td>
The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:18</font>
<td>
For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:19</font>
<td>
The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:20</font>
<td>
And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:21</font>
<td>
The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:22</font>
<td>
Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:23</font>
<td>
And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:24</font>
<td>
Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:25</font>
<td>
He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:26</font>
<td>
If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:27</font>
<td>
Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:28</font>
<td>
Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:29</font>
<td>
The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:30</font>
<td>
Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:31</font>
<td>
Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:32</font>
<td>
And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:33</font>
<td>
This he said, signifying what death he should die. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:34</font>
<td>
The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:35</font>
<td>
Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:36</font>
<td>
While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:37</font>
<td>
But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:38</font>
<td>
That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:39</font>
<td>
Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:40</font>
<td>
He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:41</font>
<td>
These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:42</font>
<td>
Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:43</font>
<td>
For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:44</font>
<td>
Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:45</font>
<td>
And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:46</font>
<td>
I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:47</font>
<td>
And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:48</font>
<td>
He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:49</font>
<td>
For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:50</font>
<td>
And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak. </table>
