10:1</font>
<td>
Hear ye the word which the LORD speaketh unto you, O house of Israel: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:2</font>
<td>
Thus saith the LORD, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:3</font>
<td>
For the customs of the people are vain: for one cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:4</font>
<td>
They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:5</font>
<td>
They are upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also is it in them to do good. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:6</font>
<td>
Forasmuch as there is none like unto thee, O LORD; thou art great, and thy name is great in might. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:7</font>
<td>
Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? for to thee doth it appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like unto thee. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:8</font>
<td>
But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock is a doctrine of vanities. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:9</font>
<td>
Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue and purple is their clothing: they are all the work of cunning men. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:10</font>
<td>
But the LORD is the true God, he is the living God, and an everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:11</font>
<td>
Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:12</font>
<td>
He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:13</font>
<td>
When he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:14</font>
<td>
Every man is brutish in his knowledge: every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:15</font>
<td>
They are vanity, and the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:16</font>
<td>
The portion of Jacob is not like them: for he is the former of all things; and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: The LORD of hosts is his name. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:17</font>
<td>
Gather up thy wares out of the land, O inhabitant of the fortress. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:18</font>
<td>
For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this once, and will distress them, that they may find it so. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:19</font>
<td>
Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous: but I said, Truly this is a grief, and I must bear it. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:20</font>
<td>
My tabernacle is spoiled, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth of me, and they are not: there is none to stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my curtains. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:21</font>
<td>
For the pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the LORD: therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flocks shall be scattered. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:22</font>
<td>
Behold, the noise of the bruit is come, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah desolate, and a den of dragons. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:23</font>
<td>
O LORD, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:24</font>
<td>
O LORD, correct me, but with judgment; not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:25</font>
<td>
Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name: for they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his habitation desolate. </table>
