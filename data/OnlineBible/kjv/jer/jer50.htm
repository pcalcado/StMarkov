The word that the LORD spake against Babylon and against the land of the Chaldeans by Jeremiah the prophet. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
50:2</font>
<td>
Declare ye among the nations, and publish, and set up a standard; publish, and conceal not: say, Babylon is taken, Bel is confounded, Merodach is broken in pieces; her idols are confounded, her images are broken in pieces. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
50:3</font>
<td>
For out of the north there cometh up a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein: they shall remove, they shall depart, both man and beast. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
50:4</font>
<td>
In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together, going and weeping: they shall go, and seek the LORD their God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
50:5</font>
<td>
They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward, saying, Come, and let us join ourselves to the LORD in a perpetual covenant that shall not be forgotten. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
50:6</font>
<td>
My people hath been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to go astray, they have turned them away on the mountains: they have gone from mountain to hill, they have forgotten their restingplace. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
50:7</font>
<td>
All that found them have devoured them: and their adversaries said, We offend not, because they have sinned against the LORD, the habitation of justice, even the LORD, the hope of their fathers. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
50:8</font>
<td>
Remove out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the he goats before the flocks. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
50:9</font>
<td>
For, lo, I will raise and cause to come up against Babylon an assembly of great nations from the north country: and they shall set themselves in array against her; from thence she shall be taken: their arrows shall be as of a mighty expert man; none shall return in vain. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
50:10</font>
<td>
And Chaldea shall be a spoil: all that spoil her shall be satisfied, saith the LORD. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
50:11</font>
<td>
Because ye were glad, because ye rejoiced, O ye destroyers of mine heritage, because ye are grown fat as the heifer at grass, and bellow as bulls; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
50:12</font>
<td>
Your mother shall be sore confounded; she that bare you shall be ashamed: behold, the hindermost of the nations shall be a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
50:13</font>
<td>
Because of the wrath of the LORD it shall not be inhabited, but it shall be wholly desolate: every one that goeth by Babylon shall be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
50:14</font>
<td>
Put yourselves in array against Babylon round about: all ye that bend the bow, shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she hath sinned against the LORD. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
50:15</font>
<td>
Shout against her round about: she hath given her hand: her foundations are fallen, her walls are thrown down: for it is the vengeance of the LORD: take vengeance upon her; as she hath done, do unto her. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
50:16</font>
<td>
Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people, and they shall flee every one to his own land. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
50:17</font>
<td>
Israel is a scattered sheep; the lions have driven him away: first the king of Assyria hath devoured him; and last this Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath broken his bones. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
50:18</font>
<td>
Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have punished the king of Assyria. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
50:19</font>
<td>
And I will bring Israel again to his habitation, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied upon mount Ephraim and Gilead. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
50:20</font>
<td>
In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I reserve. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
50:21</font>
<td>
Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod: waste and utterly destroy after them, saith the LORD, and do according to all that I have commanded thee. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
50:22</font>
<td>
A sound of battle is in the land, and of great destruction. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
50:23</font>
<td>
How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations! <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
50:24</font>
<td>
I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art also taken, O Babylon, and thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also caught, because thou hast striven against the LORD. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
50:25</font>
<td>
The LORD hath opened his armoury, and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation: for this is the work of the Lord GOD of hosts in the land of the Chaldeans. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
50:26</font>
<td>
Come against her from the utmost border, open her storehouses: cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly: let nothing of her be left. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
50:27</font>
<td>
Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe unto them! for their day is come, the time of their visitation. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
50:28</font>
<td>
The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God, the vengeance of his temple. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
50:29</font>
<td>
Call together the archers against Babylon: all ye that bend the bow, camp against it round about; let none thereof escape: recompense her according to her work; according to all that she hath done, do unto her: for she hath been proud against the LORD, against the Holy One of Israel. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
50:30</font>
<td>
Therefore shall her young men fall in the streets, and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
50:31</font>
<td>
Behold, I am against thee, O thou most proud, saith the Lord GOD of hosts: for thy day is come, the time that I will visit thee. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
50:32</font>
<td>
And the most proud shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up: and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all round about him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
50:33</font>
<td>
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The children of Israel and the children of Judah were oppressed together: and all that took them captives held them fast; they refused to let them go. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
50:34</font>
<td>
Their Redeemer is strong; the LORD of hosts is his name: he shall throughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the land, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
50:35</font>
<td>
A sword is upon the Chaldeans, saith the LORD, and upon the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her wise men. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
50:36</font>
<td>
A sword is upon the liars; and they shall dote: a sword is upon her mighty men; and they shall be dismayed. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
50:37</font>
<td>
A sword is upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and upon all the mingled people that are in the midst of her; and they shall become as women: a sword is upon her treasures; and they shall be robbed. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
50:38</font>
<td>
A drought is upon her waters; and they shall be dried up: for it is the land of graven images, and they are mad upon their idols. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
50:39</font>
<td>
Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts of the islands shall dwell there, and the owls shall dwell therein: and it shall be no more inhabited for ever; neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
50:40</font>
<td>
As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour cities thereof, saith the LORD; so shall no man abide there, neither shall any son of man dwell therein. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
50:41</font>
<td>
Behold, a people shall come from the north, and a great nation, and many kings shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
50:42</font>
<td>
They shall hold the bow and the lance: they are cruel, and will not shew mercy: their voice shall roar like the sea, and they shall ride upon horses, every one put in array, like a man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of Babylon. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
50:43</font>
<td>
The king of Babylon hath heard the report of them, and his hands waxed feeble: anguish took hold of him, and pangs as of a woman in travail. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
50:44</font>
<td>
Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan unto the habitation of the strong: but I will make them suddenly run away from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over her? for who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that shepherd that will stand before me? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
50:45</font>
<td>
Therefore hear ye the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against Babylon; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make their habitation desolate with them. <tr>
<td valign=top>

50:46</font>
<td>
At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth is moved, and the cry is heard among the nations. </table>
