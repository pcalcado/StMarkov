Then said the LORD unto me, Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, yet my mind could not be toward this people: cast them out of my sight, and let them go forth. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:2</font>
<td>
And it shall come to pass, if they say unto thee, Whither shall we go forth? then thou shalt tell them, Thus saith the LORD; Such as are for death, to death; and such as are for the sword, to the sword; and such as are for the famine, to the famine; and such as are for the captivity, to the captivity. <tr>

And I will appoint over them four kinds, saith the LORD: the sword to slay, and the dogs to tear, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and destroy. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:4</font>
<td>
And I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah, for that which he did in Jerusalem. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:5</font>
<td>
For who shall have pity upon thee, O Jerusalem? or who shall bemoan thee? or who shall go aside to ask how thou doest? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:6</font>
<td>
Thou hast forsaken me, saith the LORD, thou art gone backward: therefore will I stretch out my hand against thee, and destroy thee; I am weary with repenting. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:7</font>
<td>
And I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land; I will bereave them of children, I will destroy my people, since they return not from their ways. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:8</font>
<td>
Their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas: I have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a spoiler at noonday: I have caused him to fall upon it suddenly, and terrors upon the city. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:9</font>
<td>
She that hath borne seven languisheth: she hath given up the ghost; her sun is gone down while it was yet day: she hath been ashamed and confounded: and the residue of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies, saith the LORD. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:10</font>
<td>
Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have neither lent on usury, nor men have lent to me on usury; yet every one of them doth curse me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:11</font>
<td>
The LORD said, Verily it shall be well with thy remnant; verily I will cause the enemy to entreat thee well in the time of evil and in the time of affliction. <tr>

Shall iron break the northern iron and the steel? <tr>

Thy substance and thy treasures will I give to the spoil without price, and that for all thy sins, even in all thy borders. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:14</font>
<td>
And I will make thee to pass with thine enemies into a land which thou knowest not: for a fire is kindled in mine anger, which shall burn upon you. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:15</font>
<td>
O LORD, thou knowest: remember me, and visit me, and revenge me of my persecutors; take me not away in thy longsuffering: know that for thy sake I have suffered rebuke. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:16</font>
<td>
Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, O LORD God of hosts. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:17</font>
<td>
I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, nor rejoiced; I sat alone because of thy hand: for thou hast filled me with indignation. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:18</font>
<td>
Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, which refuseth to be healed? wilt thou be altogether unto me as a liar, and as waters that fail? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:19</font>
<td>
Therefore thus saith the LORD, If thou return, then will I bring thee again, and thou shalt stand before me: and if thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth: let them return unto thee; but return not thou unto them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:20</font>
<td>
And I will make thee unto this people a fenced brasen wall: and they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee: for I am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, saith the LORD. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:21</font>

And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible. </table>
