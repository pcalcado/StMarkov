Concerning the Ammonites, thus saith the LORD; Hath Israel no sons? hath he no heir? why then doth their king inherit Gad, and his people dwell in his cities? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
49:2</font>
<td>
Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard in Rabbah of the Ammonites; and it shall be a desolate heap, and her daughters shall be burned with fire: then shall Israel be heir unto them that were his heirs, saith the LORD. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
49:3</font>
<td>
Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled: cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro by the hedges; for their king shall go into captivity, and his priests and his princes together. <tr>
<td valign=top>

49:4</font>

Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O backsliding daughter? that trusted in her treasures, saying, Who shall come unto me? <tr>

49:5</font>

Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts, from all those that be about thee; and ye shall be driven out every man right forth; and none shall gather up him that wandereth. <tr>

<font size=-1>
49:6</font>

And afterward I will bring again the captivity of the children of Ammon, saith the LORD. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
49:7</font>
<td>
Concerning Edom, thus saith the LORD of hosts; Is wisdom no more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
49:8</font>
<td>
Flee ye, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time that I will visit him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
49:9</font>
<td>
If grapegatherers come to thee, would they not leave some gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, they will destroy till they have enough. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
49:10</font>
<td>
But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is spoiled, and his brethren, and his neighbours, and he is not. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
49:11</font>
<td>
Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and let thy widows trust in me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
49:12</font>
<td>
For thus saith the LORD; Behold, they whose judgment was not to drink of the cup have assuredly drunken; and art thou he that shall altogether go unpunished? thou shalt not go unpunished, but thou shalt surely drink of it. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
49:13</font>
<td>
For I have sworn by myself, saith the LORD, that Bozrah shall become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
49:14</font>
<td>
I have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent unto the heathen, saying, Gather ye together, and come against her, and rise up to the battle. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
49:15</font>
<td>
For, lo, I will make thee small among the heathen, and despised among men. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
49:16</font>
<td>
Thy terribleness hath deceived thee, and the pride of thine heart, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that holdest the height of the hill: though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle, I will bring thee down from thence, saith the LORD. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
49:17</font>
<td>
Also Edom shall be a desolation: every one that goeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
49:18</font>
<td>
As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour cities thereof, saith the LORD, no man shall abide there, neither shall a son of man dwell in it. <tr>

Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan against the habitation of the strong: but I will suddenly make him run away from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over her? for who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that shepherd that will stand before me? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
49:20</font>
<td>
Therefore hear the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against Edom; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make their habitations desolate with them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
49:21</font>

The earth is moved at the noise of their fall, at the cry the noise thereof was heard in the Red sea. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
49:22</font>
<td>
Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread his wings over Bozrah: and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men of Edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs. <tr>
<td valign=top>

49:23</font>
<td>
Concerning Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad: for they have heard evil tidings: they are fainthearted; there is sorrow on the sea; it cannot be quiet. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
49:24</font>
<td>
Damascus is waxed feeble, and turneth herself to flee, and fear hath seized on her: anguish and sorrows have taken her, as a woman in travail. <tr>

<font size=-1>
49:25</font>
<td>
How is the city of praise not left, the city of my joy! <tr>
<td valign=top>

Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD of hosts. <tr>

Concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon shall smite, thus saith the LORD; Arise ye, go up to Kedar, and spoil the men of the east. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
49:29</font>
<td>
Their tents and their flocks shall they take away: they shall take to themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels; and they shall cry unto them, Fear is on every side. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
49:30</font>
<td>
Flee, get you far off, dwell deep, O ye inhabitants of Hazor, saith the LORD; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you, and hath conceived a purpose against you. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
49:31</font>
<td>
Arise, get you up unto the wealthy nation, that dwelleth without care, saith the LORD, which have neither gates nor bars, which dwell alone. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
49:32</font>
<td>
And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a spoil: and I will scatter into all winds them that are in the utmost corners; and I will bring their calamity from all sides thereof, saith the LORD. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
49:33</font>
<td>
And Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons, and a desolation for ever: there shall no man abide there, nor any son of man dwell in it. <tr>

The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against Elam in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying, <tr>

Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the chief of their might. <tr>
<td valign=top>

And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall not come. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
49:37</font>
<td>
For I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before them that seek their life: and I will bring evil upon them, even my fierce anger, saith the LORD; and I will send the sword after them, till I have consumed them: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
49:38</font>
<td>
And I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from thence the king and the princes, saith the LORD. <tr>
