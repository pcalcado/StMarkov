8:1</font>
<td>
And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:2</font>
<td>
And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:3</font>
<td>
As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:4</font>
<td>
Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:5</font>
<td>
Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:6</font>
<td>
And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:7</font>
<td>
For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed with them: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:8</font>
<td>
And there was great joy in that city. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:9</font>
<td>
But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:10</font>
<td>
To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:11</font>
<td>
And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:12</font>
<td>
But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:13</font>
<td>
Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:14</font>
<td>
Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:15</font>
<td>
Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:16</font>
<td>
(For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.) <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:17</font>
<td>
Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:18</font>
<td>
And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:19</font>
<td>
Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:20</font>
<td>
But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:21</font>
<td>
Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:22</font>
<td>
Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:23</font>
<td>
For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:24</font>
<td>
Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the LORD for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:25</font>
<td>
And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:26</font>
<td>
And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:27</font>
<td>
And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:28</font>
<td>
Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:29</font>
<td>
Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:30</font>
<td>
And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:31</font>
<td>
And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:32</font>
<td>
The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:33</font>
<td>
In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:34</font>
<td>
And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:35</font>
<td>
Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:36</font>
<td>
And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:37</font>
<td>
And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:38</font>
<td>
And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:39</font>
<td>
And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:40</font>
<td>
But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea. </table>
