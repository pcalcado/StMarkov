When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question. <tr>

And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them. <tr>
<td valign=top>

And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Men and brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:8</font>
<td>
And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as he did unto us; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:9</font>
<td>
And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith. <tr>

But we believe that through the grace of the LORD Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they. <tr>

After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up: <tr>

That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these things. <tr>

15:25</font>
<td>
It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, <tr>

Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. <tr>

Which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation. <tr>
