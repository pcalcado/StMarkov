There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian band, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:2</font>
<td>
A devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:3</font>
<td>
He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:4</font>
<td>
And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:5</font>
<td>
And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname is Peter: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:6</font>
<td>
He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side: he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:7</font>
<td>
And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:8</font>
<td>
And when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent them to Joppa. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:9</font>
<td>
On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:10</font>
<td>
And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:11</font>
<td>
And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:12</font>
<td>
Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:13</font>
<td>
And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:14</font>
<td>
But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:15</font>
<td>
And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:16</font>
<td>
This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:17</font>
<td>
Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made enquiry for Simon's house, and stood before the gate, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:18</font>
<td>
And called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged there. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:19</font>
<td>
While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:20</font>
<td>
Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:21</font>
<td>
Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the cause wherefore ye are come? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:22</font>
<td>
And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:23</font>
<td>
Then called he them in, and lodged them. And on the morrow Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:24</font>
<td>
And the morrow after they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius waited for them, and had called together his kinsmen and near friends. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:25</font>
<td>
And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:26</font>
<td>
But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:27</font>
<td>
And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:28</font>
<td>
And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:29</font>
<td>
Therefore came I unto you without gainsaying, as soon as I was sent for: I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:30</font>
<td>
And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:31</font>
<td>
And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:32</font>
<td>
Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is Peter; he is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner by the sea side: who, when he cometh, shall speak unto thee. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:33</font>
<td>
Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:34</font>
<td>
Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:35</font>
<td>
But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:36</font>
<td>
The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:) <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:37</font>
<td>
That word, I say, ye know, which was published throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:38</font>
<td>
How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:39</font>
<td>
And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:40</font>
<td>
Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:41</font>
<td>
Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:42</font>
<td>
And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:43</font>
<td>
To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:44</font>
<td>
While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:45</font>
<td>
And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:46</font>
<td>
For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:47</font>
<td>
Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:48</font>
<td>
And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days. </table>
