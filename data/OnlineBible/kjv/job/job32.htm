So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
32:2</font>
<td>
Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
32:3</font>
<td>
Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
32:4</font>
<td>
Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than he. <tr>
<td valign=top>

32:5</font>

When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, then his wrath was kindled. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
32:6</font>
<td>
And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
32:7</font>
<td>
I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
32:8</font>
<td>
But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
32:9</font>
<td>
Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand judgment. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
32:10</font>
<td>
Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
32:11</font>
<td>
Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
32:12</font>
<td>
Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you that convinced Job, or that answered his words: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
32:13</font>
<td>
Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
32:14</font>
<td>
Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
32:15</font>
<td>
They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
32:16</font>
<td>
When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, and answered no more;) <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
32:17</font>
<td>
I said, I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
32:18</font>
<td>
For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
32:19</font>
<td>
Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
32:20</font>
<td>
I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
32:21</font>
<td>
Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
32:22</font>
<td>
For I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing my maker would soon take me away. </table>
