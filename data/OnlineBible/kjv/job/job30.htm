But now they that are younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock. <tr>

Yea, whereto might the strength of their hands profit me, in whom old age was perished? <tr>
<td valign=top>

For want and famine they were solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
30:4</font>
<td>
Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots for their meat. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
30:5</font>

They were driven forth from among men, (they cried after them as after a thief;) <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
30:6</font>

To dwell in the cliffs of the valleys, in caves of the earth, and in the rocks. <tr>

Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were gathered together. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
30:8</font>

They were children of fools, yea, children of base men: they were viler than the earth. <tr>

And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword. <tr>
<td valign=top>

They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
30:11</font>
<td>
Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me. <tr>
<td valign=top>

Upon my right hand rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
30:13</font>

They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper. <tr>
<td valign=top>

They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters: in the desolation they rolled themselves upon me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
30:15</font>
<td>
Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as a cloud. <tr>
<td valign=top>

And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me. <tr>

My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest. <tr>

By the great force of my disease is my garment changed: it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat. <tr>

He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes. <tr>
<td valign=top>

30:20</font>
<td>
I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou regardest me not. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
30:21</font>
<td>
Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
30:22</font>
<td>
Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride upon it, and dissolvest my substance. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
30:23</font>
<td>
For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living. <tr>
<td valign=top>

Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction. <tr>
<td valign=top>

30:25</font>
<td>
Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was not my soul grieved for the poor? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
30:26</font>
<td>
When I looked for good, then evil came unto me: and when I waited for light, there came darkness. <tr>
<td valign=top>

30:27</font>
<td>
My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction prevented me. <tr>
<td valign=top>

I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, and I cried in the congregation. <tr>

30:29</font>

I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
30:30</font>
<td>
My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
30:31</font>

My harp also is turned to mourning, and my organ into the voice of them that weep. </table>
