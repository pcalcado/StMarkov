But Job answered and said, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:2</font>
<td>
Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together! <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:3</font>
<td>
For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:4</font>
<td>
For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:5</font>
<td>
Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:6</font>
<td>
Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an egg? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:7</font>
<td>
The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:8</font>
<td>
Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the thing that I long for! <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:9</font>
<td>
Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off! <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:10</font>
<td>
Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:11</font>
<td>
What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end, that I should prolong my life? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:12</font>
<td>
Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brass? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:13</font>
<td>
Is not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:14</font>
<td>
To him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:15</font>
<td>
My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the stream of brooks they pass away; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:16</font>
<td>
Which are blackish by reason of the ice, and wherein the snow is hid: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:17</font>
<td>
What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:18</font>
<td>
The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:19</font>
<td>
The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:20</font>
<td>
They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:21</font>
<td>
For now ye are nothing; ye see my casting down, and are afraid. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:22</font>
<td>
Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:23</font>
<td>
Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:24</font>
<td>
Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:25</font>
<td>
How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:26</font>
<td>
Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, which are as wind? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:27</font>
<td>
Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig a pit for your friend. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:28</font>
<td>
Now therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident unto you if I lie. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:29</font>
<td>
Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my righteousness is in it. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:30</font>
<td>
Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things? </table>
