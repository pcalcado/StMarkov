Moreover Job continued his parable, and said, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
29:2</font>
<td>
Oh that I were as in months past, as in the days when God preserved me; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
29:3</font>
<td>
When his candle shined upon my head, and when by his light I walked through darkness; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
29:4</font>
<td>
As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God was upon my tabernacle; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
29:5</font>
<td>
When the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were about me; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
29:6</font>
<td>
When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
29:7</font>
<td>
When I went out to the gate through the city, when I prepared my seat in the street! <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
29:8</font>
<td>
The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, and stood up. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
29:9</font>
<td>
The princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their mouth. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
29:10</font>
<td>
The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
29:11</font>
<td>
When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
29:12</font>
<td>
Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and him that had none to help him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
29:13</font>
<td>
The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
29:14</font>
<td>
I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment was as a robe and a diadem. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
29:15</font>
<td>
I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
29:16</font>
<td>
I was a father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not I searched out. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
29:17</font>
<td>
And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
29:18</font>
<td>
Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the sand. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
29:19</font>
<td>
My root was spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all night upon my branch. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
29:20</font>
<td>
My glory was fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
29:21</font>
<td>
Unto me men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
29:22</font>
<td>
After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped upon them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
29:23</font>
<td>
And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
29:24</font>
<td>
If I laughed on them, they believed it not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
29:25</font>
<td>
I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one that comforteth the mourners. </table>
