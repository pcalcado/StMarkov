After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:2</font>
<td>
And Job spake, and said, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:3</font>
<td>
Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a man child conceived. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:4</font>
<td>
Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:5</font>
<td>
Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:6</font>
<td>
As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:7</font>
<td>
Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:8</font>
<td>
Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:9</font>
<td>
Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:10</font>
<td>
Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:11</font>
<td>
Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:12</font>
<td>
Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:13</font>
<td>
For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:14</font>
<td>
With kings and counsellors of the earth, which built desolate places for themselves; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:15</font>
<td>
Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:16</font>
<td>
Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never saw light. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:17</font>
<td>
There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:18</font>
<td>
There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:19</font>
<td>
The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:20</font>
<td>
Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter in soul; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:21</font>
<td>
Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:22</font>
<td>
Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:23</font>
<td>
Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:24</font>
<td>
For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:25</font>
<td>
For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:26</font>
<td>
I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came. </table>
