Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
20:2</font>
<td>
Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for this I make haste. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
20:3</font>
<td>
I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
20:4</font>
<td>
Knowest thou not this of old, since man was placed upon earth, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
20:5</font>
<td>
That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
20:6</font>
<td>
Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
20:7</font>
<td>
Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which have seen him shall say, Where is he? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
20:8</font>
<td>
He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
20:9</font>
<td>
The eye also which saw him shall see him no more; neither shall his place any more behold him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
20:10</font>
<td>
His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands shall restore their goods. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
20:11</font>
<td>
His bones are full of the sin of his youth, which shall lie down with him in the dust. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
20:12</font>
<td>
Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, though he hide it under his tongue; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
20:13</font>
<td>
Though he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still within his mouth: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
20:14</font>
<td>
Yet his meat in his bowels is turned, it is the gall of asps within him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
20:15</font>
<td>
He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
20:16</font>
<td>
He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper's tongue shall slay him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
20:17</font>
<td>
He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and butter. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
20:18</font>
<td>
That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not swallow it down: according to his substance shall the restitution be, and he shall not rejoice therein. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
20:19</font>
<td>
Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor; because he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
20:20</font>
<td>
Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not save of that which he desired. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
20:21</font>
<td>
There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man look for his goods. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
20:22</font>
<td>
In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: every hand of the wicked shall come upon him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
20:23</font>
<td>
When he is about to fill his belly, God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him, and shall rain it upon him while he is eating. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
20:24</font>
<td>
He shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of steel shall strike him through. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
20:25</font>
<td>
It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall: terrors are upon him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
20:26</font>
<td>
All darkness shall be hid in his secret places: a fire not blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
20:27</font>
<td>
The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise up against him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
20:28</font>
<td>
The increase of his house shall depart, and his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
20:29</font>
<td>
This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed unto him by God. </table>
