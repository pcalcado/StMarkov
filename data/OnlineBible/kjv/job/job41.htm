Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down? <tr>

Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn? <tr>

Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft words unto thee? <tr>

Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever? <tr>

Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens? <tr>

Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the merchants? <tr>

Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears? <tr>

Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more. <tr>

Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him? <tr>

None is so fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to stand before me? <tr>
<td valign=top>

<td>
Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him? whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine. <tr>
<td valign=top>

I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
41:13</font>

Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can come to him with his double bridle? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
41:14</font>
<td>
Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible round about. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
41:15</font>
<td>
His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
41:16</font>
<td>
One is so near to another, that no air can come between them. <tr>
<td valign=top>

41:17</font>

They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered. <tr>
<td valign=top>

By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning. <tr>
<td valign=top>

41:19</font>
<td>
Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
41:20</font>
<td>
Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
41:21</font>
<td>
His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
41:22</font>
<td>
In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
41:23</font>
<td>
The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
41:24</font>
<td>
His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether millstone. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
41:25</font>
<td>
When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
41:26</font>
<td>
The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
41:27</font>
<td>
He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
41:28</font>
<td>
The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
41:29</font>
<td>
Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
41:30</font>
<td>
Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
41:31</font>
<td>
He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
41:32</font>
<td>
He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
41:33</font>
<td>
Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear. <tr>
<td valign=top>

He beholdeth all high things: he is a king over all the children of pride. </table>
