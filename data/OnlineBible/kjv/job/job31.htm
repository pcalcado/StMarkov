I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a maid? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:2</font>
<td>
For what portion of God is there from above? and what inheritance of the Almighty from on high? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:3</font>
<td>
Is not destruction to the wicked? and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:4</font>
<td>
Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:5</font>
<td>
If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to deceit; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:6</font>
<td>
Let me be weighed in an even balance that God may know mine integrity. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:7</font>
<td>
If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:8</font>
<td>
Then let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let my offspring be rooted out. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:9</font>
<td>
If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or if I have laid wait at my neighbour's door; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:10</font>
<td>
Then let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down upon her. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:11</font>
<td>
For this is an heinous crime; yea, it is an iniquity to be punished by the judges. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:12</font>
<td>
For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction, and would root out all mine increase. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:13</font>
<td>
If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they contended with me; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:14</font>
<td>
What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:15</font>
<td>
Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:16</font>
<td>
If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:17</font>
<td>
Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:18</font>

(For from my youth he was brought up with me, as with a father, and I have guided her from my mother's womb;) <tr>
<td valign=top>

31:19</font>
<td>
If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without covering; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:20</font>
<td>
If his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:21</font>
<td>
If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my help in the gate: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:22</font>
<td>
Then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:23</font>
<td>
For destruction from God was a terror to me, and by reason of his highness I could not endure. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:24</font>
<td>
If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:25</font>
<td>
If I rejoiced because my wealth was great, and because mine hand had gotten much; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:26</font>
<td>
If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:27</font>
<td>
And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:28</font>
<td>
This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge: for I should have denied the God that is above. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:29</font>
<td>
If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:30</font>
<td>
Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:31</font>
<td>
If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his flesh! we cannot be satisfied. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:32</font>
<td>
The stranger did not lodge in the street: but I opened my doors to the traveller. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:33</font>
<td>
If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:34</font>
<td>
Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, and went not out of the door? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:35</font>
<td>
Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire is, that the Almighty would answer me, and that mine adversary had written a book. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:36</font>
<td>
Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a crown to me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:37</font>
<td>
I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near unto him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:38</font>
<td>
If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise thereof complain; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:39</font>
<td>
If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:40</font>

Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended. </table>
