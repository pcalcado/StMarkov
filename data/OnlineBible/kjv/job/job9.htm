Then Job answered and said, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:2</font>
<td>
I know it is so of a truth: but how should man be just with God? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:3</font>
<td>
If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:4</font>
<td>
He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened himself against him, and hath prospered? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:5</font>
<td>
Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his anger. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:6</font>
<td>
Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:7</font>
<td>
Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:8</font>
<td>
Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:9</font>
<td>
Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:10</font>
<td>
Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:11</font>
<td>
Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:12</font>
<td>
Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, What doest thou? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:13</font>
<td>
If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:14</font>
<td>
How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to reason with him? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:15</font>
<td>
Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, but I would make supplication to my judge. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:16</font>
<td>
If I had called, and he had answered me; yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:17</font>
<td>
For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:18</font>
<td>
He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:19</font>
<td>
If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time to plead? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:20</font>
<td>
If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: if I say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:21</font>
<td>
Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would despise my life. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:22</font>
<td>
This is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:23</font>
<td>
If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:24</font>
<td>
The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is he? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:25</font>
<td>
Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:26</font>
<td>
They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that hasteth to the prey. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:27</font>
<td>
If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort myself: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:28</font>
<td>
I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:29</font>
<td>
If I be wicked, why then labour I in vain? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:30</font>
<td>
If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:31</font>
<td>
Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:32</font>
<td>
For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we should come together in judgment. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:33</font>
<td>
Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, that might lay his hand upon us both. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:34</font>
<td>
Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:35</font>
<td>
Then would I speak, and not fear him; but it is not so with me. </table>
