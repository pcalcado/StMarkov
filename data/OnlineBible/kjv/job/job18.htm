Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, <tr>

How long will it be ere ye make an end of words? mark, and afterwards we will speak. <tr>

Wherefore are we counted as beasts, and reputed vile in your sight? <tr>

He teareth himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of his place? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:5</font>

Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine. <tr>

18:6</font>

The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle shall be put out with him. <tr>
<td valign=top>

18:7</font>
<td>
The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down. <tr>
<td valign=top>

18:8</font>

For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon a snare. <tr>

18:9</font>

The gin shall take him by the heel, and the robber shall prevail against him. <tr>
<td valign=top>

The snare is laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way. <tr>

Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive him to his feet. <tr>

His strength shall be hungerbitten, and destruction shall be ready at his side. <tr>
<td valign=top>

It shall devour the strength of his skin: even the firstborn of death shall devour his strength. <tr>

His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it shall bring him to the king of terrors. <tr>

It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because it is none of his: brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation. <tr>

His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be cut off. <tr>

His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the street. <tr>

He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world. <tr>

He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any remaining in his dwellings. <tr>

They that come after him shall be astonied at his day, as they that went before were affrighted. <tr>
