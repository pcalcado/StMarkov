15:1</font>
<td>
Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:2</font>
<td>
Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:3</font>
<td>
Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches wherewith he can do no good? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:4</font>
<td>
Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:5</font>
<td>
For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:6</font>
<td>
Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine own lips testify against thee. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:7</font>
<td>
Art thou the first man that was born? or wast thou made before the hills? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:8</font>
<td>
Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:9</font>
<td>
What knowest thou, that we know not? what understandest thou, which is not in us? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:10</font>
<td>
With us are both the grayheaded and very aged men, much elder than thy father. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:11</font>
<td>
Are the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret thing with thee? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:12</font>
<td>
Why doth thine heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes wink at, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:13</font>
<td>
That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest such words go out of thy mouth? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:14</font>
<td>
What is man, that he should be clean? and he which is born of a woman, that he should be righteous? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:15</font>
<td>
Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:16</font>
<td>
How much more abominable and filthy is man, which drinketh iniquity like water? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:17</font>
<td>
I will shew thee, hear me; and that which I have seen I will declare; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:18</font>
<td>
Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid it: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:19</font>
<td>
Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:20</font>
<td>
The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:21</font>
<td>
A dreadful sound is in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:22</font>
<td>
He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for of the sword. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:23</font>
<td>
He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it? he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:24</font>
<td>
Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:25</font>
<td>
For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:26</font>
<td>
He runneth upon him, even on his neck, upon the thick bosses of his bucklers: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:27</font>
<td>
Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh collops of fat on his flanks. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:28</font>
<td>
And he dwelleth in desolate cities, and in houses which no man inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:29</font>
<td>
He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:30</font>
<td>
He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:31</font>
<td>
Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his recompence. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:32</font>
<td>
It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:33</font>
<td>
He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:34</font>
<td>
For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:35</font>
<td>
They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly prepareth deceit. </table>
