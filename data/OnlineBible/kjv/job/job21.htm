But Job answered and said, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
21:2</font>
<td>
Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
21:3</font>
<td>
Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
21:4</font>
<td>
As for me, is my complaint to man? and if it were so, why should not my spirit be troubled? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
21:5</font>
<td>
Mark me, and be astonished, and lay your hand upon your mouth. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
21:6</font>
<td>
Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
21:7</font>
<td>
Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
21:8</font>
<td>
Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
21:9</font>
<td>
Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
21:10</font>
<td>
Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
21:11</font>
<td>
They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
21:12</font>
<td>
They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
21:13</font>
<td>
They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
21:14</font>
<td>
Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
21:15</font>
<td>
What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
21:16</font>
<td>
Lo, their good is not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
21:17</font>
<td>
How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and how oft cometh their destruction upon them! God distributeth sorrows in his anger. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
21:18</font>
<td>
They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
21:19</font>
<td>
God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him, and he shall know it. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
21:20</font>
<td>
His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
21:21</font>
<td>
For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
21:22</font>
<td>
Shall any teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
21:23</font>
<td>
One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
21:24</font>
<td>
His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
21:25</font>
<td>
And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
21:26</font>
<td>
They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
21:27</font>
<td>
Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
21:28</font>
<td>
For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? and where are the dwelling places of the wicked? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
21:29</font>
<td>
Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their tokens, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
21:30</font>
<td>
That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
21:31</font>
<td>
Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him what he hath done? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
21:32</font>
<td>
Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
21:33</font>
<td>
The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall draw after him, as there are innumerable before him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
21:34</font>
<td>
How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood? </table>
