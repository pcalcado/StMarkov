Furthermore Elihu answered and said, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
34:2</font>
<td>
Hear my words, O ye wise men; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
34:3</font>
<td>
For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
34:4</font>
<td>
Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what is good. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
34:5</font>
<td>
For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
34:6</font>
<td>
Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without transgression. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
34:7</font>
<td>
What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
34:8</font>
<td>
Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
34:9</font>
<td>
For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
34:10</font>
<td>
Therefore hearken unto me ye men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
34:11</font>
<td>
For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to his ways. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
34:12</font>
<td>
Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
34:13</font>
<td>
Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
34:14</font>
<td>
If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
34:15</font>
<td>
All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
34:16</font>
<td>
If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
34:17</font>
<td>
Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
34:18</font>
<td>
Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked? and to princes, Ye are ungodly? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
34:19</font>
<td>
How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all are the work of his hands. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
34:20</font>
<td>
In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
34:21</font>
<td>
For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
34:22</font>
<td>
There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
34:23</font>
<td>
For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should enter into judgment with God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
34:24</font>
<td>
He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
34:25</font>
<td>
Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
34:26</font>
<td>
He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
34:27</font>
<td>
Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
34:28</font>
<td>
So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
34:29</font>
<td>
When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
34:30</font>
<td>
That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
34:31</font>
<td>
Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
34:32</font>
<td>
That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
34:33</font>
<td>
Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
34:34</font>
<td>
Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
34:35</font>
<td>
Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
34:36</font>
<td>
My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked men. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
34:37</font>
<td>
For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands among us, and multiplieth his words against God. </table>
