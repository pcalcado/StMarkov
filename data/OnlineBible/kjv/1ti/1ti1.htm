Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope; <tr>

Unto Timothy, my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord. <tr>

As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:4</font>
<td>
Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:5</font>
<td>
Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned: <tr>
<td valign=top>

From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling; <tr>

Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm. <tr>

But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>

Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, <tr>

For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine; <tr>

According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust. <tr>

And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry; <tr>

Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief. <tr>

And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. <tr>

This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief. <tr>

Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting. <tr>
