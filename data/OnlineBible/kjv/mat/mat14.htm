<td>
At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:2</font>
<td>
And said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:3</font>
<td>
For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:4</font>
<td>
For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:5</font>
<td>
And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:6</font>
<td>
But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:7</font>
<td>
Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:8</font>
<td>
And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me here John Baptist's head in a charger. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:9</font>
<td>
And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath's sake, and them which sat with him at meat, he commanded it to be given her. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:10</font>
<td>
And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:11</font>
<td>
And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the damsel: and she brought it to her mother. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:12</font>
<td>
And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it, and went and told Jesus. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:13</font>
<td>
When Jesus heard of it, he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart: and when the people had heard thereof, they followed him on foot out of the cities. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:14</font>
<td>
And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:15</font>
<td>
And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:16</font>
<td>
But Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them to eat. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:17</font>
<td>
And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:18</font>
<td>
He said, Bring them hither to me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:19</font>
<td>
And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:20</font>
<td>
And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:21</font>
<td>
And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:22</font>
<td>
And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:23</font>
<td>
And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:24</font>
<td>
But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:25</font>
<td>
And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:26</font>
<td>
And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:27</font>
<td>
But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:28</font>
<td>
And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:29</font>
<td>
And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:30</font>
<td>
But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:31</font>
<td>
And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:32</font>
<td>
And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:33</font>
<td>
Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:34</font>
<td>
And when they were gone over, they came into the land of Gennesaret. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:35</font>
<td>
And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all that country round about, and brought unto him all that were diseased; <tr>

And besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole. </table>
