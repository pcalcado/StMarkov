15:1</font>
<td>
Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:2</font>
<td>
Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:3</font>
<td>
But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:4</font>
<td>
For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:5</font>
<td>
But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:6</font>
<td>
And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:7</font>
<td>
Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:8</font>
<td>
This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:9</font>
<td>
But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:10</font>
<td>
And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:11</font>
<td>
Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:12</font>
<td>
Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:13</font>
<td>
But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:14</font>
<td>
Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:15</font>
<td>
Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:16</font>
<td>
And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:17</font>
<td>
Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:18</font>
<td>
But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:19</font>
<td>
For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:20</font>
<td>
These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:21</font>
<td>
Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:22</font>
<td>
And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:23</font>
<td>
But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:24</font>
<td>
But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:25</font>
<td>
Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:26</font>
<td>
But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:27</font>
<td>
And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:28</font>
<td>
Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:29</font>
<td>
And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:30</font>
<td>
And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:31</font>
<td>
Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:32</font>
<td>
Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:33</font>
<td>
And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:34</font>
<td>
And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:35</font>
<td>
And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:36</font>
<td>
And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:37</font>
<td>
And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:38</font>
<td>
And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:39</font>
<td>
And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala. </table>
