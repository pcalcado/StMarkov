Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
25:2</font>
<td>
And five of them were wise, and five were foolish. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
25:3</font>
<td>
They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
25:4</font>
<td>
But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
25:5</font>
<td>
While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
25:6</font>
<td>
And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
25:7</font>
<td>
Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
25:8</font>
<td>
And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
25:9</font>
<td>
But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
25:10</font>
<td>
And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
25:11</font>
<td>
Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
25:12</font>
<td>
But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
25:13</font>
<td>
Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
25:14</font>
<td>
For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
25:15</font>
<td>
And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
25:16</font>
<td>
Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made them other five talents. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
25:17</font>
<td>
And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
25:18</font>
<td>
But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
25:19</font>
<td>
After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
25:20</font>
<td>
And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
25:21</font>
<td>
His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
25:22</font>
<td>
He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
25:23</font>
<td>
His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
25:24</font>
<td>
Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
25:25</font>
<td>
And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
25:26</font>
<td>
His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
25:27</font>
<td>
Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
25:28</font>
<td>
Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
25:29</font>
<td>
For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
25:30</font>
<td>
And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
25:31</font>
<td>
When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
25:32</font>
<td>
And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
25:33</font>
<td>
And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
25:34</font>
<td>
Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
25:35</font>
<td>
For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
25:36</font>
<td>
Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
25:37</font>
<td>
Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
25:38</font>
<td>
When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
25:39</font>
<td>
Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
25:40</font>
<td>
And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
25:41</font>
<td>
Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
25:42</font>
<td>
For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
25:43</font>
<td>
I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
25:44</font>
<td>
Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
25:45</font>
<td>
Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
25:46</font>
<td>
And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal. </table>
