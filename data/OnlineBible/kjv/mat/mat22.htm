22:1</font>
<td>
And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:2</font>
<td>
The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his son, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:3</font>
<td>
And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding: and they would not come. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:4</font>
<td>
Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come unto the marriage. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:5</font>
<td>
But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:6</font>
<td>
And the remnant took his servants, and entreated them spitefully, and slew them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:7</font>
<td>
But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:8</font>
<td>
Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:9</font>
<td>
Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:10</font>
<td>
So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:11</font>
<td>
And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:12</font>
<td>
And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:13</font>
<td>
Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:14</font>
<td>
For many are called, but few are chosen. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:15</font>
<td>
Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:16</font>
<td>
And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou regardest not the person of men. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:17</font>
<td>
Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:18</font>
<td>
But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:19</font>
<td>
Shew me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:20</font>
<td>
And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:21</font>
<td>
They say unto him, Caesar's. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:22</font>
<td>
When they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left him, and went their way. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:23</font>
<td>
The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection, and asked him, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:24</font>
<td>
Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:25</font>
<td>
Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto his brother: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:26</font>
<td>
Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:27</font>
<td>
And last of all the woman died also. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:28</font>
<td>
Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:29</font>
<td>
Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:30</font>
<td>
For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:31</font>
<td>
But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:32</font>
<td>
I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:33</font>
<td>
And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:34</font>
<td>
But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:35</font>
<td>
Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:36</font>
<td>
Master, which is the great commandment in the law? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:37</font>
<td>
Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:38</font>
<td>
This is the first and great commandment. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:39</font>
<td>
And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:40</font>
<td>
On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:41</font>
<td>
While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:42</font>
<td>
Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say unto him, The son of David. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:43</font>
<td>
He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:44</font>
<td>
The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:45</font>
<td>
If David then call him Lord, how is he his son? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:46</font>
<td>
And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions. </table>
