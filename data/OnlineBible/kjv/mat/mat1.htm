Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost. <tr>
<td valign=top>

Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily. <tr>

<font size=-1>
1:20</font>
<td>
But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>

And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins. <tr>

Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us. <tr>
