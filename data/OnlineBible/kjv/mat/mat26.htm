26:1</font>
<td>
And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:2</font>
<td>
Ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:3</font>
<td>
Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:4</font>
<td>
And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:5</font>
<td>
But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar among the people. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:6</font>
<td>
Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:7</font>
<td>
There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:8</font>
<td>
But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:9</font>
<td>
For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:10</font>
<td>
When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:11</font>
<td>
For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:12</font>
<td>
For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:13</font>
<td>
Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:14</font>
<td>
Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:15</font>
<td>
And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:16</font>
<td>
And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:17</font>
<td>
Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:18</font>
<td>
And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:19</font>
<td>
And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:20</font>
<td>
Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:21</font>
<td>
And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:22</font>
<td>
And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:23</font>
<td>
And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:24</font>
<td>
The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:25</font>
<td>
Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:26</font>
<td>
And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:27</font>
<td>
And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:28</font>
<td>
For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:29</font>
<td>
But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:30</font>
<td>
And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:31</font>
<td>
Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:32</font>
<td>
But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:33</font>
<td>
Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:34</font>
<td>
Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:35</font>
<td>
Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:36</font>
<td>
Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:37</font>
<td>
And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:38</font>
<td>
Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:39</font>
<td>
And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:40</font>
<td>
And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:41</font>
<td>
Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:42</font>
<td>
He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:43</font>
<td>
And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:44</font>
<td>
And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:45</font>
<td>
Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:46</font>
<td>
Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:47</font>
<td>
And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:48</font>
<td>
Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:49</font>
<td>
And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:50</font>
<td>
And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:51</font>
<td>
And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:52</font>
<td>
Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:53</font>
<td>
Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:54</font>
<td>
But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:55</font>
<td>
In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:56</font>
<td>
But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:57</font>
<td>
And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:58</font>
<td>
But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:59</font>
<td>
Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:60</font>
<td>
But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:61</font>
<td>
And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:62</font>
<td>
And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:63</font>
<td>
But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:64</font>
<td>
Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:65</font>
<td>
Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:66</font>
<td>
What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:67</font>
<td>
Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:68</font>
<td>
Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:69</font>
<td>
Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:70</font>
<td>
But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:71</font>
<td>
And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:72</font>
<td>
And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:73</font>
<td>
And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:74</font>
<td>
Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:75</font>
<td>
And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly. </table>
