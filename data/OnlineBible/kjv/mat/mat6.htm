6:1</font>
<td>
Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:2</font>
<td>
Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:3</font>
<td>
But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:4</font>
<td>
That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:5</font>
<td>
And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:6</font>
<td>
But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:7</font>
<td>
But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:8</font>
<td>
Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:9</font>
<td>
After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:10</font>
<td>
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:11</font>
<td>
Give us this day our daily bread. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:12</font>
<td>
And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:13</font>
<td>
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:14</font>
<td>
For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:15</font>
<td>
But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:16</font>
<td>
Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:17</font>
<td>
But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:18</font>
<td>
That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:19</font>
<td>
Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:20</font>
<td>
But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:21</font>
<td>
For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:22</font>
<td>
The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:23</font>
<td>
But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness! <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:24</font>
<td>
No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:25</font>
<td>
Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:26</font>
<td>
Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:27</font>
<td>
Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:28</font>
<td>
And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:29</font>
<td>
And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:30</font>
<td>
Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:31</font>
<td>
Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:32</font>
<td>
(For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:33</font>
<td>
But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:34</font>
<td>
Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof. </table>
