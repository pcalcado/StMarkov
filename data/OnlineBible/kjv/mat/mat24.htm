24:1</font>
<td>
And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:2</font>
<td>
And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these things? verily I say unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:3</font>
<td>
And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:4</font>
<td>
And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:5</font>
<td>
For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:6</font>
<td>
And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:7</font>
<td>
For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:8</font>
<td>
All these are the beginning of sorrows. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:9</font>
<td>
Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:10</font>
<td>
And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:11</font>
<td>
And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:12</font>
<td>
And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:13</font>
<td>
But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:14</font>
<td>
And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:15</font>
<td>
When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand:) <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:16</font>
<td>
Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:17</font>
<td>
Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:18</font>
<td>
Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:19</font>
<td>
And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days! <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:20</font>
<td>
But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:21</font>
<td>
For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:22</font>
<td>
And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:23</font>
<td>
Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:24</font>
<td>
For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:25</font>
<td>
Behold, I have told you before. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:26</font>
<td>
Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:27</font>
<td>
For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:28</font>
<td>
For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:29</font>
<td>
Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:30</font>
<td>
And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:31</font>
<td>
And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:32</font>
<td>
Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:33</font>
<td>
So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:34</font>
<td>
Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:35</font>
<td>
Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:36</font>
<td>
But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:37</font>
<td>
But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:38</font>
<td>
For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:39</font>
<td>
And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:40</font>
<td>
Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:41</font>
<td>
Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:42</font>
<td>
Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:43</font>
<td>
But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:44</font>
<td>
Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:45</font>
<td>
Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:46</font>
<td>
Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:47</font>
<td>
Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all his goods. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:48</font>
<td>
But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:49</font>
<td>
And shall begin to smite his fellowservants, and to eat and drink with the drunken; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:50</font>
<td>
The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:51</font>
<td>
And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. </table>
