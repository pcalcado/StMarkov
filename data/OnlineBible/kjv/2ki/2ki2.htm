And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so. <tr>

And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:12</font>

And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces. <tr>
<td valign=top>

<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:15</font>
<td>
And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:16</font>
<td>
And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master: lest peradventure the Spirit of the LORD hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, Ye shall not send. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:17</font>
<td>
And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not. <tr>

2:19</font>
<td>
And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water is naught, and the ground barren. <tr>

<td>
And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus saith the LORD, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or barren land. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:22</font>

So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spake. <tr>
