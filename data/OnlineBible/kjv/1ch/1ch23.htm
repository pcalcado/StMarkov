So when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son king over Israel. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:2</font>
<td>
And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:3</font>
<td>
Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand. <tr>

23:4</font>
<td>
Of which, twenty and four thousand were to set forward the work of the house of the LORD; and six thousand were officers and judges: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:5</font>
<td>
Moreover four thousand were porters; and four thousand praised the LORD with the instruments which I made, said David, to praise therewith. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:6</font>
<td>
And David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi, namely, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. <tr>

<td>
Of the Gershonites were, Laadan, and Shimei. <tr>

And the sons of Shimei were, Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:11</font>
<td>
And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons; therefore they were in one reckoning, according to their father's house. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:12</font>
<td>
The sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:13</font>
<td>
The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons for ever, to burn incense before the LORD, to minister unto him, and to bless in his name for ever. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:14</font>

Now concerning Moses the man of God, his sons were named of the tribe of Levi. <tr>

<td>
The sons of Merari; Mahli, and Mushi. The sons of Mahli; Eleazar, and Kish. <tr>

<td>
The sons of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three. <tr>

<td>
These were the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers; even the chief of the fathers, as they were counted by number of names by their polls, that did the work for the service of the house of the LORD, from the age of twenty years and upward. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:25</font>
<td>
For David said, The LORD God of Israel hath given rest unto his people, that they may dwell in Jerusalem for ever: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:26</font>
<td>
And also unto the Levites; they shall no more carry the tabernacle, nor any vessels of it for the service thereof. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:27</font>
<td>
For by the last words of David the Levites were numbered from twenty years old and above: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:28</font>
<td>
Because their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the LORD, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, and the work of the service of the house of God; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:29</font>
<td>
Both for the shewbread, and for the fine flour for meat offering, and for the unleavened cakes, and for that which is baked in the pan, and for that which is fried, and for all manner of measure and size; <tr>
<td valign=top>

23:30</font>
<td>
And to stand every morning to thank and praise the LORD, and likewise at even; <tr>

And to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the LORD in the sabbaths, in the new moons, and on the set feasts, by number, according to the order commanded unto them, continually before the LORD: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:32</font>
