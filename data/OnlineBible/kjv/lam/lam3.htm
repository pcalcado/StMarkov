3:1</font>
<td>
I AM the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:2</font>
<td>
He hath led me, and brought me into darkness, but not into light. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:3</font>
<td>
Surely against me is he turned; he turneth his hand against me all the day. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:4</font>
<td>
My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:5</font>
<td>
He hath builded against me, and compassed me with gall and travail. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:6</font>
<td>
He hath set me in dark places, as they that be dead of old. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:7</font>
<td>
He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out: he hath made my chain heavy. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:8</font>
<td>
Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:9</font>
<td>
He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths crooked. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:10</font>
<td>
He was unto me as a bear lying in wait, and as a lion in secret places. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:11</font>
<td>
He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he hath made me desolate. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:12</font>
<td>
He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:13</font>
<td>
He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:14</font>
<td>
I was a derision to all my people; and their song all the day. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:15</font>
<td>
He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken with wormwood. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:16</font>
<td>
He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath covered me with ashes. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:17</font>
<td>
And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace: I forgat prosperity. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:18</font>
<td>
And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the LORD: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:19</font>
<td>
Remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:20</font>
<td>
My soul hath them still in remembrance, and is humbled in me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:21</font>
<td>
This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:22</font>
<td>
It is of the LORD's mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:23</font>
<td>
They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:24</font>
<td>
The LORD is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:25</font>
<td>
The LORD is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that seeketh him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:26</font>
<td>
It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the LORD. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:27</font>
<td>
It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:28</font>
<td>
He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because he hath borne it upon him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:29</font>
<td>
He putteth his mouth in the dust; if so be there may be hope. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:30</font>
<td>
He giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him: he is filled full with reproach. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:31</font>
<td>
For the LORD will not cast off for ever: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:32</font>
<td>
But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:33</font>
<td>
For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:34</font>
<td>
To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:35</font>
<td>
To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most High, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:36</font>
<td>
To subvert a man in his cause, the LORD approveth not. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:37</font>
<td>
Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord commandeth it not? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:38</font>
<td>
Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and good? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:39</font>
<td>
Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:40</font>
<td>
Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the LORD. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:41</font>
<td>
Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:42</font>
<td>
We have transgressed and have rebelled: thou hast not pardoned. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:43</font>
<td>
Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us: thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:44</font>
<td>
Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that our prayer should not pass through. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:45</font>
<td>
Thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:46</font>
<td>
All our enemies have opened their mouths against us. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:47</font>
<td>
Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:48</font>
<td>
Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:49</font>
<td>
Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:50</font>
<td>
Till the LORD look down, and behold from heaven. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:51</font>
<td>
Mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my city. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:52</font>
<td>
Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:53</font>
<td>
They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone upon me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:54</font>
<td>
Waters flowed over mine head; then I said, I am cut off. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:55</font>
<td>
I called upon thy name, O LORD, out of the low dungeon. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:56</font>
<td>
Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:57</font>
<td>
Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee: thou saidst, Fear not. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:58</font>
<td>
O LORD, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:59</font>
<td>
O LORD, thou hast seen my wrong: judge thou my cause. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:60</font>
<td>
Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their imaginations against me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:61</font>
<td>
Thou hast heard their reproach, O LORD, and all their imaginations against me; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:62</font>
<td>
The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:63</font>
<td>
Behold their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their musick. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:64</font>
<td>
Render unto them a recompence, O LORD, according to the work of their hands. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:65</font>
<td>
Give them sorrow of heart, thy curse unto them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:66</font>
<td>
Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the LORD. </table>
