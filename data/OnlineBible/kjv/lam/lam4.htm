<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:6</font>

For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom, that was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands stayed on her. <tr>
<td valign=top>

4:7</font>

Her Nazarites were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk, they were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing was of sapphire: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:8</font>
<td>
Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the streets: their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is withered, it is become like a stick. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:9</font>
<td>
They that be slain with the sword are better than they that be slain with hunger: for these pine away, stricken through for want of the fruits of the field. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:10</font>
<td>
The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children: they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people. <tr>

For the sins of her prophets, and the iniquities of her priests, that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her, <tr>

They have wandered as blind men in the streets, they have polluted themselves with blood, so that men could not touch their garments. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:15</font>

They cried unto them, Depart ye; it is unclean; depart, depart, touch not: when they fled away and wandered, they said among the heathen, They shall no more sojourn there. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:16</font>
<td>
The anger of the LORD hath divided them; he will no more regard them: they respected not the persons of the priests, they favoured not the elders. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:17</font>
