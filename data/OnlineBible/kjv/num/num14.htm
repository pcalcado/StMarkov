And wherefore hath the LORD brought us unto this land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be a prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt? <tr>

And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land: for they have heard that thou LORD art among this people, that thou LORD art seen face to face, and that thy cloud standeth over them, and that thou goest before them, by day time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>

And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my LORD be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying, <tr>
<td valign=top>

The LORD is longsuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation. <tr>

But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it. <tr>

Your carcases shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, which have murmured against me, <tr>

But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:32</font>
<td>
But as for you, your carcases, they shall fall in this wilderness. <tr>
<td valign=top>

<td>
And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted in the wilderness. <tr>

14:34</font>
<td>
After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, even forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, even forty years, and ye shall know my breach of promise. <tr>

I the LORD have said, I will surely do it unto all this evil congregation, that are gathered together against me: in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die. <tr>

<td>
Even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land, died by the plague before the LORD. <tr>
