And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying, <tr>

<font size=-1>
9:2</font>

Let the children of Israel also keep the passover at his appointed season. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>

In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in his appointed season: according to all the rites of it, and according to all the ceremonies thereof, shall ye keep it. <tr>

And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keep the passover. <tr>

And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at even in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:6</font>
<td>
And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of a man, that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:7</font>
<td>
And those men said unto him, We are defiled by the dead body of a man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in his appointed season among the children of Israel? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:8</font>

And Moses said unto them, Stand still, and I will hear what the LORD will command concerning you. <tr>

<font size=-1>
9:9</font>

And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:10</font>
<td>
Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover unto the LORD. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:11</font>

The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep it, and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. <tr>

<font size=-1>
9:12</font>
<td>
They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone of it: according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:13</font>
<td>
But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people: because he brought not the offering of the LORD in his appointed season, that man shall bear his sin. <tr>
<td valign=top>

9:14</font>
<td>
And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover unto the LORD; according to the ordinance of the passover, and according to the manner thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one ordinance, both for the stranger, and for him that was born in the land. <tr>

And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony: and at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until the morning. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:16</font>
<td>
So it was alway: the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance of fire by night. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:17</font>
<td>
And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel pitched their tents. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:18</font>
<td>
At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of the LORD they pitched: as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:19</font>
<td>
And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD, and journeyed not. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:20</font>
<td>
And so it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; according to the commandment of the LORD they abode in their tents, and according to the commandment of the LORD they journeyed. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:21</font>
<td>
And so it was, when the cloud abode from even unto the morning, and that the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they journeyed: whether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up, they journeyed. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:22</font>
<td>
Or whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the children of Israel abode in their tents, and journeyed not: but when it was taken up, they journeyed. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:23</font>

At the commandment of the LORD they rested in the tents, and at the commandment of the LORD they journeyed: they kept the charge of the LORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses. </table>
