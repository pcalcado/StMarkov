<td>
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:2</font>
<td>
Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites: afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:3</font>
<td>
And Moses spake unto the people, saying, Arm some of yourselves unto the war, and let them go against the Midianites, and avenge the LORD of Midian. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:4</font>
<td>
Of every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel, shall ye send to the war. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:5</font>
<td>
So there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:6</font>
<td>
And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand of every tribe, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the holy instruments, and the trumpets to blow in his hand. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:7</font>
<td>
And they warred against the Midianites, as the LORD commanded Moses; and they slew all the males. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:8</font>
<td>
And they slew the kings of Midian, beside the rest of them that were slain; namely, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:9</font>
<td>
And the children of Israel took all the women of Midian captives, and their little ones, and took the spoil of all their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:10</font>
<td>
And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt, and all their goodly castles, with fire. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:11</font>
<td>
And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of men and of beasts. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:12</font>
<td>
And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, unto Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and unto the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by Jordan near Jericho. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:13</font>
<td>
And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the congregation, went forth to meet them without the camp. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:14</font>
<td>
And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, with the captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, which came from the battle. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:15</font>
<td>
And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:16</font>
<td>
Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the LORD in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation of the LORD. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:17</font>
<td>
Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:18</font>
<td>
But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:19</font>
<td>
And do ye abide without the camp seven days: whosoever hath killed any person, and whosoever hath touched any slain, purify both yourselves and your captives on the third day, and on the seventh day. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:20</font>
<td>
And purify all your raiment, and all that is made of skins, and all work of goats' hair, and all things made of wood. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:21</font>
<td>
And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went to the battle, This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD commanded Moses; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:22</font>
<td>
Only the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:23</font>
<td>
Every thing that may abide the fire, ye shall make it go through the fire, and it shall be clean: nevertheless it shall be purified with the water of separation: and all that abideth not the fire ye shall make go through the water. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:24</font>
<td>
And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye shall be clean, and afterward ye shall come into the camp. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:25</font>
<td>
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:26</font>
<td>
Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of beast, thou, and Eleazar the priest, and the chief fathers of the congregation: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:27</font>
<td>
And divide the prey into two parts; between them that took the war upon them, who went out to battle, and between all the congregation: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:28</font>
<td>
And levy a tribute unto the Lord of the men of war which went out to battle: one soul of five hundred, both of the persons, and of the beeves, and of the asses, and of the sheep: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:29</font>
<td>
Take it of their half, and give it unto Eleazar the priest, for an heave offering of the LORD. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:30</font>
<td>
And of the children of Israel's half, thou shalt take one portion of fifty, of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses, and of the flocks, of all manner of beasts, and give them unto the Levites, which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:31</font>
<td>
And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded Moses. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:32</font>
<td>
And the booty, being the rest of the prey which the men of war had caught, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:33</font>
<td>
And threescore and twelve thousand beeves, <tr>
<td valign=top>

And threescore and one thousand asses, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>

<td>
And thirty and two thousand persons in all, of women that had not known man by lying with him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:36</font>
<td>
And the half, which was the portion of them that went out to war, was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty thousand and five hundred sheep: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:37</font>
<td>
And the LORD's tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:38</font>
<td>
And the beeves were thirty and six thousand; of which the LORD's tribute was threescore and twelve. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:39</font>

And the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred; of which the LORD's tribute was threescore and one. <tr>

And the persons were sixteen thousand; of which the LORD's tribute was thirty and two persons. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:41</font>
<td>
And Moses gave the tribute, which was the LORD's heave offering, unto Eleazar the priest, as the LORD commanded Moses. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:42</font>
<td>
And of the children of Israel's half, which Moses divided from the men that warred, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:43</font>
<td>
(Now the half that pertained unto the congregation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep, <tr>

31:44</font>

And sixteen thousand persons;) <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:47</font>
<td>
Even of the children of Israel's half, Moses took one portion of fifty, both of man and of beast, and gave them unto the Levites, which kept the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:48</font>
<td>
And the officers which were over thousands of the host, the captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, came near unto Moses: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:49</font>
<td>
And they said unto Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war which are under our charge, and there lacketh not one man of us. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:50</font>
<td>
We have therefore brought an oblation for the LORD, what every man hath gotten, of jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings, earrings, and tablets, to make an atonement for our souls before the LORD. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
31:51</font>
