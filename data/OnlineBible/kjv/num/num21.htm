And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and he called the name of the place Hormah. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
21:4</font>
<td>
And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
21:5</font>
<td>
And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, neither is there any water; and our soul loatheth this light bread. <tr>

Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD, and against thee; pray unto the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people. <tr>

21:12</font>
<td>
From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
21:13</font>
<td>
From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the Amorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites. <tr>
<td valign=top>

Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it: <tr>
<td valign=top>

<td>
And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
21:22</font>
<td>
Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink of the waters of the well: but we will go along by the king's high way, until we be past thy borders. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
21:23</font>
<td>
And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
21:24</font>
<td>
And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon was strong. <tr>

<td>
And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
21:26</font>
<td>
For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even unto Arnon. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
21:27</font>
<td>
Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon, let the city of Sihon be built and prepared: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
21:28</font>
<td>
For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it hath consumed Ar of Moab, and the lords of the high places of Arnon. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>

<td>
Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he hath given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity unto Sihon king of the Amorites. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
21:30</font>
<td>
We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and we have laid them waste even unto Nophah, which reacheth unto Medeba. <tr>
<td valign=top>

21:31</font>
<td>
Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites. <tr>
<td valign=top>

<font size=-1>
21:34</font>
<td>
And the LORD said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
21:35</font>
<td>
So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was none left him alive: and they possessed his land. </table>
