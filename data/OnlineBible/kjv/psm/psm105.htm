Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD. <tr>

Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore. <tr>

Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth; <tr>

105:6</font>
<td>
O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his chosen. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
105:7</font>
<td>
He is the LORD our God: his judgments are in all the earth. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
105:8</font>
<td>
He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
105:9</font>
<td>
Which covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
105:10</font>
<td>
And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
105:11</font>
<td>
Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
105:12</font>
<td>
When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
105:13</font>
<td>
When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another people; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
105:14</font>
<td>
He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
105:15</font>
<td>
Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
105:16</font>

Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole staff of bread. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
105:17</font>

He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a servant: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
105:18</font>

Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron: <tr>

Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried him. <tr>
<td valign=top>

<td>
The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people, and let him go free. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
105:21</font>
<td>
He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
105:22</font>
<td>
To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom. <tr>
<td valign=top>

<td>
Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
105:24</font>
<td>
And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
105:25</font>
<td>
He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
105:26</font>
<td>
He sent Moses his servant; and Aaron whom he had chosen. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
105:27</font>
<td>
They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
105:28</font>
<td>
He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
105:29</font>
<td>
He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
105:30</font>
<td>
Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
105:31</font>
<td>
He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, and lice in all their coasts. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
105:32</font>
<td>
He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
105:33</font>
<td>
He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
105:34</font>
<td>
He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that without number, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
105:35</font>
<td>
And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
105:36</font>
<td>
He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
105:37</font>
<td>
He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and there was not one feeble person among their tribes. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
105:38</font>
<td>
Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
105:39</font>
<td>
He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
105:40</font>
<td>
The people asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
105:41</font>
<td>
He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places like a river. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
105:42</font>
<td>
For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
105:43</font>
<td>
And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with gladness: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
105:44</font>
<td>
And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the labour of the people; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
105:45</font>
<td>
That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise ye the LORD. </table>
