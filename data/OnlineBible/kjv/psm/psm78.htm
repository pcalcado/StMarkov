Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:2</font>
<td>
I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:3</font>
<td>
Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:4</font>
<td>
We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:5</font>
<td>
For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:6</font>
<td>
That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:7</font>
<td>
That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:8</font>
<td>
And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:9</font>
<td>
The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:10</font>
<td>
They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:11</font>
<td>
And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:12</font>
<td>
Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:13</font>
<td>
He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:14</font>
<td>
In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:15</font>
<td>
He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:16</font>
<td>
He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:17</font>
<td>
And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:18</font>
<td>
And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:19</font>
<td>
Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:20</font>
<td>
Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:21</font>
<td>
Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:22</font>
<td>
Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:23</font>
<td>
Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:24</font>
<td>
And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:25</font>
<td>
Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:26</font>
<td>
He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:27</font>
<td>
He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:28</font>
<td>
And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:29</font>
<td>
So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:30</font>
<td>
They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat was yet in their mouths, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:31</font>
<td>
The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:32</font>
<td>
For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:33</font>
<td>
Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:34</font>
<td>
When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:35</font>
<td>
And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:36</font>
<td>
Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:37</font>
<td>
For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:38</font>
<td>
But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:39</font>
<td>
For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:40</font>
<td>
How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert! <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:41</font>
<td>
Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:42</font>
<td>
They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:43</font>
<td>
How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:44</font>
<td>
And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:45</font>
<td>
He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:46</font>
<td>
He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:47</font>
<td>
He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:48</font>
<td>
He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:49</font>
<td>
He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:50</font>
<td>
He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:51</font>
<td>
And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:52</font>
<td>
But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:53</font>
<td>
And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:54</font>
<td>
And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:55</font>
<td>
He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:56</font>
<td>
Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:57</font>
<td>
But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:58</font>
<td>
For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:59</font>
<td>
When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:60</font>
<td>
So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:61</font>
<td>
And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:62</font>
<td>
He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:63</font>
<td>
The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:64</font>
<td>
Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:65</font>
<td>
Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:66</font>
<td>
And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:67</font>
<td>
Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:68</font>
<td>
But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:69</font>
<td>
And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:70</font>
<td>
He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:71</font>
<td>
From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
78:72</font>
<td>
So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands. </table>
