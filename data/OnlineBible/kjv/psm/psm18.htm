I will love thee, O LORD, my strength. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:2</font>
<td>
The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:3</font>
<td>
I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:4</font>
<td>
The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:5</font>
<td>
The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:6</font>
<td>
In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, even into his ears. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:7</font>
<td>
Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:8</font>
<td>
There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:9</font>
<td>
He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness was under his feet. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:10</font>
<td>
And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:11</font>
<td>
He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:12</font>
<td>
At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed, hail stones and coals of fire. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:13</font>
<td>
The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail stones and coals of fire. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:14</font>
<td>
Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:15</font>
<td>
Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:16</font>
<td>
He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:17</font>
<td>
He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong for me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:18</font>
<td>
They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:19</font>
<td>
He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:20</font>
<td>
The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:21</font>
<td>
For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:22</font>
<td>
For all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:23</font>
<td>
I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:24</font>
<td>
Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:25</font>
<td>
With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:26</font>
<td>
With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:27</font>
<td>
For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high looks. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:28</font>
<td>
For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten my darkness. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:29</font>
<td>
For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:30</font>
<td>
As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all those that trust in him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:31</font>
<td>
For who is God save the LORD? or who is a rock save our God? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:32</font>
<td>
It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:33</font>
<td>
He maketh my feet like hinds' feet, and setteth me upon my high places. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:34</font>
<td>
He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:35</font>
<td>
Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:36</font>
<td>
Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:37</font>
<td>
I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:38</font>
<td>
I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:39</font>
<td>
For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:40</font>
<td>
Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:41</font>
<td>
They cried, but there was none to save them: even unto the LORD, but he answered them not. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:42</font>
<td>
Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:43</font>
<td>
Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people whom I have not known shall serve me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:44</font>
<td>
As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:45</font>

The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:46</font>

The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:47</font>

It is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:48</font>

He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man. <tr>

Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and sing praises unto thy name. <tr>

Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore. </table>
