Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever. <tr>

106:2</font>

Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? who can shew forth all his praise? <tr>
<td valign=top>

106:3</font>
<td>
Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth righteousness at all times. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
106:4</font>
<td>
Remember me, O LORD, with the favour that thou bearest unto thy people: O visit me with thy salvation; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
106:5</font>
<td>
That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
106:6</font>
<td>
We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
106:7</font>
<td>
Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked him at the sea, even at the Red sea. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
106:8</font>
<td>
Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
106:9</font>
<td>
He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
106:10</font>
<td>
And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
106:11</font>
<td>
And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
106:12</font>
<td>
Then believed they his words; they sang his praise. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
106:13</font>
<td>
They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
106:14</font>
<td>
But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
106:15</font>
<td>
And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
106:16</font>
<td>
They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the LORD. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
106:17</font>
<td>
The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
106:18</font>
<td>
And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
106:19</font>
<td>
They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
106:20</font>
<td>
Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
106:21</font>
<td>
They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
106:22</font>
<td>
Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red sea. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
106:23</font>
<td>
Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
106:24</font>
<td>
Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
106:25</font>
<td>
But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
106:26</font>
<td>
Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
106:27</font>
<td>
To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
106:28</font>
<td>
They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
106:29</font>
<td>
Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
106:30</font>
<td>
Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the plague was stayed. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
106:31</font>
<td>
And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
106:32</font>
<td>
They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
106:33</font>
<td>
Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
106:34</font>
<td>
They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
106:35</font>
<td>
But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
106:36</font>
<td>
And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
106:37</font>
<td>
Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
106:38</font>
<td>
And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
106:39</font>
<td>
Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
106:40</font>
<td>
Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
106:41</font>
<td>
And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
106:42</font>
<td>
Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
106:43</font>
<td>
Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
106:44</font>
<td>
Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
106:45</font>
<td>
And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
106:46</font>
<td>
He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
106:47</font>
<td>
Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise. <tr>

Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD. </table>
