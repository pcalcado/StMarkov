5:1</font>
<td>
But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:2</font>
<td>
For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:3</font>
<td>
For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:4</font>
<td>
But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:5</font>
<td>
Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:6</font>
<td>
Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:7</font>
<td>
For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:8</font>
<td>
But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:9</font>
<td>
For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:10</font>
<td>
Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:11</font>
<td>
Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:12</font>
<td>
And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:13</font>
<td>
And to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. And be at peace among yourselves. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:14</font>
<td>
Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:15</font>
<td>
See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:16</font>
<td>
Rejoice evermore. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:17</font>

Pray without ceasing. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:18</font>
<td>
In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:19</font>
<td>
Quench not the Spirit. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:20</font>
<td>
Despise not prophesyings. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:21</font>
<td>
Prove all things; hold fast that which is good. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:22</font>
<td>
Abstain from all appearance of evil. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:23</font>
<td>
And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. <tr>

5:24</font>

Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it. <tr>

Brethren, pray for us. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:26</font>
<td>
Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:27</font>

I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren. <tr>

The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen. </table>
