Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity. <tr>

1:3</font>
<td>
What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun? <tr>

One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever. <tr>

1:5</font>
<td>
The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:6</font>
<td>
The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits. <tr>
<td valign=top>

1:7</font>
<td>
All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:8</font>
<td>
All things are full of labour; man cannot utter it: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:9</font>
<td>
The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:10</font>

Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:11</font>
<td>
There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after. <tr>

I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem. <tr>
<td valign=top>

And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:14</font>
<td>
I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit. <tr>

1:15</font>
<td>
That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:16</font>
<td>
I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:17</font>

And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit. <tr>

For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow. </table>
