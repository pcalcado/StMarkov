8:1</font>
<td>
Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? a man's wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of his face shall be changed. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:2</font>
<td>
I counsel thee to keep the king's commandment, and that in regard of the oath of God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:3</font>
<td>
Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing; for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:4</font>
<td>
Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say unto him, What doest thou? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:5</font>
<td>
Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise man's heart discerneth both time and judgment. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:6</font>
<td>
Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the misery of man is great upon him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:7</font>
<td>
For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him when it shall be? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:8</font>
<td>
There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither hath he power in the day of death: and there is no discharge in that war; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:9</font>
<td>
All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: there is a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:10</font>
<td>
And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done: this is also vanity. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:11</font>
<td>
Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:12</font>
<td>
Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:13</font>
<td>
But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow; because he feareth not before God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:14</font>
<td>
There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be just men, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there be wicked men, to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also is vanity. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:15</font>
<td>
Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth him under the sun. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:16</font>
<td>
When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth: (for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:) <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:17</font>
<td>
Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea farther; though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it. </table>
