10:1</font>
<td>
Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour: so doth a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom and honour. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:2</font>
<td>
A wise man's heart is at his right hand; but a fool's heart at his left. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:3</font>
<td>
Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wisdom faileth him, and he saith to every one that he is a fool. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:4</font>
<td>
If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for yielding pacifieth great offences. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:5</font>
<td>
There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as an error which proceedeth from the ruler: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:6</font>
<td>
Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:7</font>
<td>
I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:8</font>
<td>
He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh an hedge, a serpent shall bite him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:9</font>
<td>
Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:10</font>
<td>
If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:11</font>
<td>
Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler is no better. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:12</font>
<td>
The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:13</font>
<td>
The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness: and the end of his talk is mischievous madness. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:14</font>
<td>
A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be; and what shall be after him, who can tell him? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:15</font>
<td>
The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how to go to the city. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:16</font>
<td>
Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes eat in the morning! <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:17</font>
<td>
Blessed art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness! <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:18</font>
<td>
By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:19</font>
<td>
A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money answereth all things. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
10:20</font>
<td>
Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter. </table>
