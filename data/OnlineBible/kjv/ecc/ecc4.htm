4:1</font>
<td>
So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:2</font>
<td>
Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:3</font>
<td>
Yea, better is he than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:4</font>
<td>
Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This is also vanity and vexation of spirit. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:5</font>
<td>
The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:6</font>
<td>
Better is an handful with quietness, than both the hands full with travail and vexation of spirit. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:7</font>
<td>
Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:8</font>
<td>
There is one alone, and there is not a second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither saith he, For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good? This is also vanity, yea, it is a sore travail. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:9</font>
<td>
Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:10</font>
<td>
For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:11</font>
<td>
Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm alone? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:12</font>
<td>
And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:13</font>
<td>
Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:14</font>
<td>
For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also he that is born in his kingdom becometh poor. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:15</font>
<td>
I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:16</font>
<td>
There is no end of all the people, even of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit. </table>
