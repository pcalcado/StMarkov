To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven: <tr>

A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted; <tr>

What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth? <tr>

I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:11</font>
<td>
He hath made every thing beautiful in his time: also he hath set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end. <tr>

3:12</font>

I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to rejoice, and to do good in his life. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:13</font>
<td>
And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it is the gift of God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:14</font>
<td>
I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth it, that men should fear before him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:15</font>
<td>
That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that which is past. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:16</font>
<td>
And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, that wickedness was there; and the place of righteousness, that iniquity was there. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:17</font>
<td>
I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:18</font>
<td>
I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:19</font>
<td>
For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity. <tr>

3:20</font>
<td>
All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again. <tr>
<td valign=top>

3:21</font>
<td>
Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth? <tr>
<td valign=top>

3:22</font>
<td>
Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him? </table>
