7:1</font>
<td>
A good name is better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of one's birth. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:2</font>
<td>
It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to his heart. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:3</font>
<td>
Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:4</font>
<td>
The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:5</font>
<td>
It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:6</font>
<td>
For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool: this also is vanity. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:7</font>
<td>
Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the heart. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:8</font>
<td>
Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:9</font>
<td>
Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:10</font>
<td>
Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:11</font>
<td>
Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and by it there is profit to them that see the sun. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:12</font>
<td>
For wisdom is a defence, and money is a defence: but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to them that have it. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:13</font>
<td>
Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which he hath made crooked? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:14</font>
<td>
In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also hath set the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:15</font>
<td>
All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just man that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedness. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:16</font>
<td>
Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself ? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:17</font>
<td>
Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:18</font>
<td>
It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:19</font>
<td>
Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which are in the city. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:20</font>
<td>
For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:21</font>
<td>
Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:22</font>
<td>
For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:23</font>
<td>
All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it was far from me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:24</font>
<td>
That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:25</font>
<td>
I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and the reason of things, and to know the wickedness of folly, even of foolishness and madness: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:26</font>
<td>
And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart is snares and nets, and her hands as bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:27</font>
<td>
Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, counting one by one, to find out the account: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:28</font>
<td>
Which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
7:29</font>
<td>
Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions. </table>
