The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth. <tr>

<font size=-1>
1:2</font>
<td>
Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:3</font>
<td>
For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:4</font>
<td>
I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:5</font>
<td>
Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:6</font>
<td>
Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church: whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do well: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:7</font>
<td>
Because that for his name's sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:8</font>
<td>
We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:9</font>
<td>
I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:10</font>
<td>
Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out of the church. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:11</font>
<td>
Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:12</font>
<td>
Demetrius hath good report of all men, and of the truth itself: yea, and we also bear record; and ye know that our record is true. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:13</font>
<td>
I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:14</font>
<td>
But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee. Greet the friends by name. </table>
