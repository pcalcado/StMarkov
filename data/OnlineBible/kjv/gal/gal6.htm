6:1</font>
<td>
Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:2</font>
<td>
Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:3</font>
<td>
For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:4</font>
<td>
But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:5</font>
<td>
For every man shall bear his own burden. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:6</font>
<td>
Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:7</font>
<td>
Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:8</font>
<td>
For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:9</font>
<td>
And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:10</font>
<td>
As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:11</font>
<td>
Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:12</font>
<td>
As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:13</font>
<td>
For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:14</font>
<td>
But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:15</font>
<td>
For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:16</font>
<td>
And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:17</font>
<td>
From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:18</font>
<td>
Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen. </table>
