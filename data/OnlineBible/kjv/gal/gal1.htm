Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;) <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:2</font>
<td>
And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:3</font>
<td>
Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:4</font>
<td>
Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:5</font>
<td>
To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:6</font>
<td>
I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:7</font>
<td>
Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:8</font>
<td>
But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:9</font>
<td>
As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:10</font>
<td>
For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:11</font>
<td>
But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:12</font>
<td>
For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:13</font>
<td>
For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:14</font>
<td>
And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:15</font>
<td>
But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:16</font>
<td>
To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:17</font>
<td>
Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:18</font>
<td>
Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:19</font>
<td>
But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:20</font>
<td>
Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:21</font>
<td>
Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:22</font>
<td>
And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:23</font>
<td>
But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:24</font>
<td>
And they glorified God in me. </table>
