3:1</font>
<td>
O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:2</font>
<td>
This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:3</font>
<td>
Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:4</font>
<td>
Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:5</font>
<td>
He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:6</font>
<td>
Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:7</font>
<td>
Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:8</font>
<td>
And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:9</font>
<td>
So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:10</font>
<td>
For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:11</font>
<td>
But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:12</font>
<td>
And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:13</font>
<td>
Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:14</font>
<td>
That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:15</font>
<td>
Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:16</font>
<td>
Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:17</font>
<td>
And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:18</font>
<td>
For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:19</font>
<td>
Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:20</font>
<td>
Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:21</font>
<td>
Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:22</font>
<td>
But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:23</font>
<td>
But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:24</font>
<td>
Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:25</font>
<td>
But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:26</font>
<td>
For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:27</font>
<td>
For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:28</font>
<td>
There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:29</font>
<td>
And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise. </table>
