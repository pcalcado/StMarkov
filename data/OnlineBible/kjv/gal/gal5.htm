5:1</font>
<td>
Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:2</font>
<td>
Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:3</font>
<td>
For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:4</font>
<td>
Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:5</font>
<td>
For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:6</font>
<td>
For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:7</font>
<td>
Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:8</font>
<td>
This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:9</font>
<td>
A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:10</font>
<td>
I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:11</font>
<td>
And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:12</font>
<td>
I would they were even cut off which trouble you. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:13</font>
<td>
For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:14</font>
<td>
For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:15</font>
<td>
But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:16</font>
<td>
This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:17</font>
<td>
For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:18</font>
<td>
But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:19</font>
<td>
Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:20</font>
<td>
Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:21</font>
<td>
Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:22</font>
<td>
But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:23</font>
<td>
Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:24</font>
<td>
And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:25</font>
<td>
If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:26</font>
<td>
Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another. </table>
