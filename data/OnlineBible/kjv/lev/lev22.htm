Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, and that they profane not my holy name in those things which they hallow unto me: I am the LORD. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:3</font>
<td>
Say unto them, Whosoever he be of all your seed among your generations, that goeth unto the holy things, which the children of Israel hallow unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from my presence: I am the LORD. <tr>
<td valign=top>

22:4</font>
<td>
What man soever of the seed of Aaron is a leper, or hath a running issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he be clean. And whoso toucheth any thing that is unclean by the dead, or a man whose seed goeth from him; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:5</font>

Or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing, whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatsoever uncleanness he hath; <tr>

The soul which hath touched any such shall be unclean until even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he wash his flesh with water. <tr>

And when the sun is down, he shall be clean, and shall afterward eat of the holy things; because it is his food. <tr>

That which dieth of itself, or is torn with beasts, he shall not eat to defile himself therewith: I am the LORD. <tr>

They shall therefore keep mine ordinance, lest they bear sin for it, and die therefore, if they profane it: I the LORD do sanctify them. <tr>

There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of the priest, or an hired servant, shall not eat of the holy thing. <tr>
<td valign=top>

But if the priest buy any soul with his money, he shall eat of it, and he that is born in his house: they shall eat of his meat. <tr>

If the priest's daughter also be married unto a stranger, she may not eat of an offering of the holy things. <tr>

Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eat their holy things: for I the LORD do sanctify them. <tr>

And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, <tr>

<td>
Speak unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them, Whatsoever he be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that will offer his oblation for all his vows, and for all his freewill offerings, which they will offer unto the LORD for a burnt offering; <tr>

And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD to accomplish his vow, or a freewill offering in beeves or sheep, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish therein. <tr>

Either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or lacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer for a freewill offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted. <tr>

Neither from a stranger's hand shall ye offer the bread of your God of any of these; because their corruption is in them, and blemishes be in them: they shall not be accepted for you. <tr>
