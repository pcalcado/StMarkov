26:1</font>
<td>
Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up a standing image, neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I am the LORD your God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:2</font>
<td>
Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the LORD. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:3</font>
<td>
If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:4</font>
<td>
Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:5</font>
<td>
And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:6</font>
<td>
And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:7</font>

And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword. <tr>
<td valign=top>

26:8</font>
<td>
And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:9</font>

For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and establish my covenant with you. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:10</font>
<td>
And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of the new. <tr>

And I will set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you. <tr>

And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people. <tr>
<td valign=top>

I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the bands of your yoke, and made you go upright. <tr>
<td valign=top>

26:14</font>

But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:15</font>
<td>
And if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your soul abhor my judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but that ye break my covenant: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:16</font>
<td>
I also will do this unto you; I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:17</font>
<td>
And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:18</font>
<td>
And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:19</font>
<td>
And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:20</font>
<td>
And your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:21</font>
<td>
And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:22</font>
<td>
I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your high ways shall be desolate. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:23</font>
<td>
And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will walk contrary unto me; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:24</font>
<td>
Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish you yet seven times for your sins. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:25</font>
<td>
And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel of my covenant: and when ye are gathered together within your cities, I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:26</font>
<td>
And when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:27</font>
<td>
And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:28</font>
<td>
Then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:29</font>
<td>
And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:30</font>
<td>
And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:31</font>
<td>
And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:32</font>
<td>
And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:33</font>
<td>
And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:34</font>
<td>
Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye be in your enemies' land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:35</font>
<td>
As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:36</font>
<td>
And upon them that are left alive of you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:37</font>
<td>
And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:38</font>
<td>
And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:39</font>
<td>
And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:40</font>
<td>
If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary unto me; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:41</font>
<td>
And that I also have walked contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:42</font>
<td>
Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:43</font>
<td>
The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:44</font>
<td>
And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I am the LORD their God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
26:45</font>
<td>
But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God: I am the LORD. <tr>

These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses. </table>
