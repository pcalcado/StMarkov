And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them, <tr>

Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the beasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earth. <tr>

Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, and cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:4</font>

Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the hoof: as the camel, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you. <tr>

And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you. <tr>

And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you. <tr>

And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted, yet he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you. <tr>

Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not touch; they are unclean to you. <tr>

These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall ye eat. <tr>

And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which is in the waters, they shall be an abomination unto you: <tr>

And upon whatsoever any of them, when they are dead, doth fall, it shall be unclean; whether it be any vessel of wood, or raiment, or skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel it be, wherein any work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; so it shall be cleansed. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>

And every earthen vessel, whereinto any of them falleth, whatsoever is in it shall be unclean; and ye shall break it. <tr>

And every thing whereupon any part of their carcase falleth shall be unclean; whether it be oven, or ranges for pots, they shall be broken down: for they are unclean, and shall be unclean unto you. <tr>

Nevertheless a fountain or pit, wherein there is plenty of water, shall be clean: but that which toucheth their carcase shall be unclean. <tr>
