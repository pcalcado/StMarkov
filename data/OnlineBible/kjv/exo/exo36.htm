Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whom the LORD put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that the LORD had commanded. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
36:2</font>

And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom, even every one whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
36:3</font>

And they received of Moses all the offering, which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make it withal. And they brought yet unto him free offerings every morning. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
36:4</font>

And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary, came every man from his work which they made; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
36:5</font>

And they spake unto Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work, which the LORD commanded to make. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
36:6</font>
<td>
And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained from bringing. <tr>
<td valign=top>

For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
36:8</font>
<td>
And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubims of cunning work made he them. <tr>
<td valign=top>

36:9</font>

The length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits, and the breadth of one curtain four cubits: the curtains were all of one size. <tr>

And he coupled the five curtains one unto another: and the other five curtains he coupled one unto another. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
36:11</font>

And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the uttermost side of another curtain, in the coupling of the second. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
36:12</font>

Fifty loops made he in one curtain, and fifty loops made he in the edge of the curtain which was in the coupling of the second: the loops held one curtain to another. <tr>

One board had two tenons, equally distant one from another: thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle. <tr>
