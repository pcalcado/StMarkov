Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:2</font>
<td>
For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:3</font>
<td>
But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:4</font>
<td>
He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:5</font>
<td>
I would that ye all spake with tongues, but rather that ye prophesied: for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:6</font>
<td>
Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:7</font>
<td>
And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:8</font>
<td>
For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:9</font>
<td>
So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:10</font>
<td>
There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is without signification. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:11</font>
<td>
Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:12</font>
<td>
Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:13</font>
<td>
Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:14</font>
<td>
For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:15</font>
<td>
What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:16</font>
<td>
Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:17</font>
<td>
For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:18</font>
<td>
I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:19</font>
<td>
Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:20</font>
<td>
Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:21</font>
<td>
In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, saith the LORD. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:22</font>
<td>
Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not, but for them which believe. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:23</font>
<td>
If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:24</font>
<td>
But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:25</font>
<td>
And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on his face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:26</font>
<td>
How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:27</font>
<td>
If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:28</font>
<td>
But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:29</font>
<td>
Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:30</font>
<td>
If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:31</font>
<td>
For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:32</font>
<td>
And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:33</font>
<td>
For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:34</font>
<td>
Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the law. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:35</font>
<td>
And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:36</font>
<td>
What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you only? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:37</font>
<td>
If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:38</font>
<td>
But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:39</font>
<td>
Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
14:40</font>
<td>
Let all things be done decently and in order. </table>
