3:1</font>
<td>
And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:2</font>
<td>
I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:3</font>
<td>
For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:4</font>
<td>
For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not carnal? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:5</font>
<td>
Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:6</font>
<td>
I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:7</font>
<td>
So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:8</font>
<td>
Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:9</font>
<td>
For we are labourers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:10</font>
<td>
According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:11</font>
<td>
For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:12</font>
<td>
Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:13</font>
<td>
Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:14</font>
<td>
If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:15</font>
<td>
If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:16</font>
<td>
Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:17</font>
<td>
If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:18</font>
<td>
Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:19</font>
<td>
For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:20</font>
<td>
And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:21</font>
<td>
Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:22</font>
<td>
Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:23</font>
<td>
And ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's. </table>
