11:1</font>
<td>
Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:2</font>
<td>
Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:3</font>
<td>
But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:4</font>
<td>
Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:5</font>
<td>
But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:6</font>
<td>
For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:7</font>
<td>
For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:8</font>
<td>
For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:9</font>
<td>
Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:10</font>
<td>
For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:11</font>
<td>
Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:12</font>
<td>
For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things of God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:13</font>
<td>
Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:14</font>
<td>
Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:15</font>
<td>
But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:16</font>
<td>
But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:17</font>
<td>
Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:18</font>
<td>
For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:19</font>
<td>
For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:20</font>
<td>
When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:21</font>
<td>
For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:22</font>
<td>
What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:23</font>
<td>
For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:24</font>
<td>
And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:25</font>
<td>
After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:26</font>
<td>
For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:27</font>
<td>
Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:28</font>
<td>
But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:29</font>
<td>
For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:30</font>
<td>
For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:31</font>
<td>
For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:32</font>
<td>
But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:33</font>
<td>
Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:34</font>
<td>
And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come. </table>
