6:1</font>
<td>
Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:2</font>
<td>
Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:3</font>
<td>
Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:4</font>
<td>
If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:5</font>
<td>
I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:6</font>
<td>
But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:7</font>
<td>
Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:8</font>
<td>
Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:9</font>
<td>
Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:10</font>
<td>
Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:11</font>
<td>
And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:12</font>
<td>
All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:13</font>
<td>
Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:14</font>
<td>
And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:15</font>
<td>
Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:16</font>
<td>
What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:17</font>
<td>
But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:18</font>
<td>
Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:19</font>
<td>
What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:20</font>
<td>
For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's. </table>
