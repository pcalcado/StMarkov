5:1</font>
<td>
It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:2</font>
<td>
And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:3</font>
<td>
For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that hath so done this deed, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:4</font>
<td>
In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:5</font>
<td>
To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:6</font>
<td>
Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:7</font>
<td>
Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:8</font>
<td>
Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:9</font>
<td>
I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:10</font>
<td>
Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:11</font>
<td>
But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:12</font>
<td>
For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:13</font>
<td>
But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person. </table>
