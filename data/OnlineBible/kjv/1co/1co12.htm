12:1</font>
<td>
Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:2</font>
<td>
Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:3</font>
<td>
Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:4</font>
<td>
Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:5</font>
<td>
And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:6</font>
<td>
And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:7</font>
<td>
But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:8</font>
<td>
For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:9</font>
<td>
To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:10</font>
<td>
To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:11</font>
<td>
But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:12</font>
<td>
For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:13</font>
<td>
For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:14</font>
<td>
For the body is not one member, but many. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:15</font>
<td>
If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:16</font>
<td>
And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:17</font>
<td>
If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:18</font>
<td>
But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:19</font>
<td>
And if they were all one member, where were the body? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:20</font>
<td>
But now are they many members, yet but one body. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:21</font>
<td>
And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:22</font>
<td>
Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:23</font>
<td>
And those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:24</font>
<td>
For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:25</font>
<td>
That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:26</font>
<td>
And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:27</font>
<td>
Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:28</font>
<td>
And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:29</font>
<td>
Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:30</font>
<td>
Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
12:31</font>
<td>
But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way. </table>
