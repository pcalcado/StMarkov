9:1</font>
<td>
Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:2</font>
<td>
If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:3</font>
<td>
Mine answer to them that do examine me is this, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:4</font>
<td>
Have we not power to eat and to drink? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:5</font>
<td>
Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and as the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:6</font>
<td>
Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:7</font>
<td>
Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:8</font>
<td>
Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:9</font>
<td>
For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:10</font>
<td>
Or saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:11</font>
<td>
If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:12</font>
<td>
If others be partakers of this power over you, are not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:13</font>
<td>
Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:14</font>
<td>
Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:15</font>
<td>
But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:16</font>
<td>
For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel! <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:17</font>
<td>
For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:18</font>
<td>
What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:19</font>
<td>
For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:20</font>
<td>
And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:21</font>
<td>
To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:22</font>
<td>
To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:23</font>
<td>
And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:24</font>
<td>
Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:25</font>
<td>
And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:26</font>
<td>
I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
9:27</font>
<td>
But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway. </table>
