Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:2</font>
<td>
And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:3</font>
<td>
Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:4</font>
<td>
I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:5</font>
<td>
Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:6</font>
<td>
That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:7</font>
<td>
For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:8</font>
<td>
Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:9</font>
<td>
Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:10</font>
<td>
I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:11</font>
<td>
Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:12</font>
<td>
Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:13</font>
<td>
Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:14</font>
<td>
But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:15</font>
<td>
For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:16</font>
<td>
Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:17</font>
<td>
If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:18</font>
<td>
If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:19</font>
<td>
I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:20</font>
<td>
Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:21</font>
<td>
Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:22</font>
<td>
But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:23</font>
<td>
There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:24</font>
<td>
Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:25</font>
<td>
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen. </table>
