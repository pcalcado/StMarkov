23:4</font>
<td>
Because they met you not with bread and with water in the way, when ye came forth out of Egypt; and because they hired against thee Balaam the son of Beor of Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse thee. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:5</font>
<td>
Nevertheless the LORD thy God would not hearken unto Balaam; but the LORD thy God turned the curse into a blessing unto thee, because the LORD thy God loved thee. <tr>

Thou shalt not seek their peace nor their prosperity all thy days for ever. <tr>
<td valign=top>

23:7</font>
<td>
Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite; for he is thy brother: thou shalt not abhor an Egyptian; because thou wast a stranger in his land. <tr>

The children that are begotten of them shall enter into the congregation of the LORD in their third generation. <tr>

When the host goeth forth against thine enemies, then keep thee from every wicked thing. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:10</font>
<td>
If there be among you any man, that is not clean by reason of uncleanness that chanceth him by night, then shall he go abroad out of the camp, he shall not come within the camp: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:11</font>
<td>
But it shall be, when evening cometh on, he shall wash himself with water: and when the sun is down, he shall come into the camp again. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:12</font>
<td>
Thou shalt have a place also without the camp, whither thou shalt go forth abroad: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:13</font>
<td>
And thou shalt have a paddle upon thy weapon; and it shall be, when thou wilt ease thyself abroad, thou shalt dig therewith, and shalt turn back and cover that which cometh from thee: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:14</font>
<td>
For the LORD thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp, to deliver thee, and to give up thine enemies before thee; therefore shall thy camp be holy: that he see no unclean thing in thee, and turn away from thee. <tr>

<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:18</font>
<td>
Thou shalt not bring the hire of a whore, or the price of a dog, into the house of the LORD thy God for any vow: for even both these are abomination unto the LORD thy God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:19</font>
<td>
Thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy brother; usury of money, usury of victuals, usury of any thing that is lent upon usury: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:20</font>
<td>
Unto a stranger thou mayest lend upon usury; but unto thy brother thou shalt not lend upon usury: that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all that thou settest thine hand to in the land whither thou goest to possess it. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:21</font>
<td>
When thou shalt vow a vow unto the LORD thy God, thou shalt not slack to pay it: for the LORD thy God will surely require it of thee; and it would be sin in thee. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:22</font>
<td>
But if thou shalt forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in thee. <tr>

23:24</font>
<td>
When thou comest into thy neighbour's vineyard, then thou mayest eat grapes thy fill at thine own pleasure; but thou shalt not put any in thy vessel. <tr>
