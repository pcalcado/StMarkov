11:1</font>
<td>
When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:2</font>
<td>
As they called them, so they went from them: they sacrificed unto Baalim, and burned incense to graven images. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:3</font>
<td>
I taught Ephraim also to go, taking them by their arms; but they knew not that I healed them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:4</font>
<td>
I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love: and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I laid meat unto them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:5</font>
<td>
He shall not return into the land of Egypt, but the Assyrian shall be his king, because they refused to return. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:6</font>
<td>
And the sword shall abide on his cities, and shall consume his branches, and devour them, because of their own counsels. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:7</font>
<td>
And my people are bent to backsliding from me: though they called them to the most High, none at all would exalt him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:8</font>
<td>
How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? how shall I deliver thee, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? how shall I set thee as Zeboim? mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:9</font>
<td>
I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of thee: and I will not enter into the city. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:10</font>
<td>
They shall walk after the LORD: he shall roar like a lion: when he shall roar, then the children shall tremble from the west. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
11:11</font>
<td>
They shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria: and I will place them in their houses, saith the LORD. <tr>
<td valign=top>

11:12</font>
<td>
Ephraim compasseth me about with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit: but Judah yet ruleth with God, and is faithful with the saints. </table>
