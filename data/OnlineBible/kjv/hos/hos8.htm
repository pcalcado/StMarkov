Israel hath cast off the thing that is good: the enemy shall pursue him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:4</font>
<td>
They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes, and I knew it not: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off. <tr>

Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast thee off; mine anger is kindled against them: how long will it be ere they attain to innocency? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:6</font>
<td>
For from Israel was it also: the workman made it; therefore it is not God: but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:7</font>
<td>
For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: it hath no stalk: the bud shall yield no meal: if so be it yield, the strangers shall swallow it up. <tr>

<font size=-1>
8:8</font>

Israel is swallowed up: now shall they be among the Gentiles as a vessel wherein is no pleasure. <tr>
<td valign=top>

Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin, altars shall be unto him to sin. <tr>

They sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of mine offerings, and eat it; but the LORD accepteth them not; now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins: they shall return to Egypt. <tr>

For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples; and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities: but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof. </table>
