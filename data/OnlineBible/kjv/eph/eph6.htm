6:1</font>
<td>
Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:2</font>
<td>
Honour thy father and mother; which is the first commandment with promise; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:3</font>
<td>
That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:4</font>
<td>
And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:5</font>
<td>
Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:6</font>
<td>
Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:7</font>
<td>
With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:8</font>
<td>
Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:9</font>
<td>
And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:10</font>
<td>
Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:11</font>
<td>
Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:12</font>
<td>
For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:13</font>
<td>
Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:14</font>
<td>
Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:15</font>
<td>
And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:16</font>
<td>
Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:17</font>
<td>
And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:18</font>
<td>
Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:19</font>
<td>
And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:20</font>
<td>
For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:21</font>
<td>
But that ye also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:22</font>
<td>
Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:23</font>
<td>
Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:24</font>
<td>
Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen. </table>
