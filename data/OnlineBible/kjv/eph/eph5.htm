5:1</font>
<td>
Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:2</font>
<td>
And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:3</font>
<td>
But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:4</font>
<td>
Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:5</font>
<td>
For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:6</font>
<td>
Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:7</font>
<td>
Be not ye therefore partakers with them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:8</font>
<td>
For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:9</font>
<td>
(For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;) <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:10</font>
<td>
Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:11</font>
<td>
And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:12</font>
<td>
For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:13</font>
<td>
But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:14</font>
<td>
Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:15</font>
<td>
See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:16</font>
<td>
Redeeming the time, because the days are evil. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:17</font>
<td>
Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:18</font>
<td>
And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:19</font>
<td>
Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:20</font>
<td>
Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:21</font>
<td>
Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:22</font>
<td>
Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:23</font>
<td>
For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:24</font>
<td>
Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:25</font>
<td>
Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:26</font>
<td>
That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:27</font>
<td>
That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:28</font>
<td>
So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:29</font>
<td>
For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:30</font>
<td>
For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:31</font>
<td>
For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:32</font>
<td>
This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:33</font>
<td>
Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband. </table>
