Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:4</font>
<td>
According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:5</font>
<td>
Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:6</font>

To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved. <tr>

In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace; <tr>

Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence; <tr>

<td>
Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:10</font>
<td>
That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:11</font>

In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will: <tr>

That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ. <tr>

In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise, <tr>

Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory. <tr>

Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:16</font>
<td>
Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers; <tr>

That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him: <tr>

The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints, <tr>

1:19</font>
<td>
And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power, <tr>

<font size=-1>
1:20</font>
<td>
Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:21</font>
<td>
Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come: <tr>

<font size=-1>
1:22</font>
<td>
And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church, <tr>
<td valign=top>

Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all. </table>
