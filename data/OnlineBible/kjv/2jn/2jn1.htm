The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:2</font>
<td>
For the truth's sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:3</font>
<td>
Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:4</font>
<td>
I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:5</font>
<td>
And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:6</font>
<td>
And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:7</font>
<td>
For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:8</font>
<td>
Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:9</font>
<td>
Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:10</font>
<td>
If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:11</font>
<td>
For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:12</font>
<td>
Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:13</font>
<td>
The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen. </table>
