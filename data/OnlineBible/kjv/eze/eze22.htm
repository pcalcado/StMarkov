Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:2</font>
<td>
Now, thou son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the bloody city? yea, thou shalt shew her all her abominations. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:3</font>
<td>
Then say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD, The city sheddeth blood in the midst of it, that her time may come, and maketh idols against herself to defile herself. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:4</font>
<td>
Thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed; and hast defiled thyself in thine idols which thou hast made; and thou hast caused thy days to draw near, and art come even unto thy years: therefore have I made thee a reproach unto the heathen, and a mocking to all countries. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:5</font>
<td>
Those that be near, and those that be far from thee, shall mock thee, which art infamous and much vexed. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:6</font>
<td>
Behold, the princes of Israel, every one were in thee to their power to shed blood. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:7</font>
<td>
In thee have they set light by father and mother: in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger: in thee have they vexed the fatherless and the widow. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:8</font>
<td>
Thou hast despised mine holy things, and hast profaned my sabbaths. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:9</font>
<td>
In thee are men that carry tales to shed blood: and in thee they eat upon the mountains: in the midst of thee they commit lewdness. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:10</font>
<td>
In thee have they discovered their fathers' nakedness: in thee have they humbled her that was set apart for pollution. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:11</font>
<td>
And one hath committed abomination with his neighbour's wife; and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter in law; and another in thee hath humbled his sister, his father's daughter. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:12</font>
<td>
In thee have they taken gifts to shed blood; thou hast taken usury and increase, and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbours by extortion, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord GOD. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:13</font>
<td>
Behold, therefore I have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gain which thou hast made, and at thy blood which hath been in the midst of thee. <tr>
<td valign=top>

22:14</font>
<td>
Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with thee? I the LORD have spoken it, and will do it. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:15</font>
<td>
And I will scatter thee among the heathen, and disperse thee in the countries, and will consume thy filthiness out of thee. <tr>
<td valign=top>

22:16</font>
<td>
And thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight of the heathen, and thou shalt know that I am the LORD. <tr>

22:17</font>
<td>
And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:18</font>
<td>
Son of man, the house of Israel is to me become dross: all they are brass, and tin, and iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they are even the dross of silver. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:19</font>
<td>
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye are all become dross, behold, therefore I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:20</font>
<td>
As they gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin, into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt it; so will I gather you in mine anger and in my fury, and I will leave you there, and melt you. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:21</font>
<td>
Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst thereof. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:22</font>
<td>
As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I the LORD have poured out my fury upon you. <tr>

22:23</font>
<td>
And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:24</font>
<td>
Son of man, say unto her, Thou art the land that is not cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of indignation. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:25</font>
<td>
There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the prey; they have devoured souls; they have taken the treasure and precious things; they have made her many widows in the midst thereof. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:26</font>
<td>
Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy things: they have put no difference between the holy and profane, neither have they shewed difference between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:27</font>
<td>
Her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood, and to destroy souls, to get dishonest gain. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:28</font>
<td>
And her prophets have daubed them with untempered morter, seeing vanity, and divining lies unto them, saying, Thus saith the Lord GOD, when the LORD hath not spoken. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:29</font>
<td>
The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery, and have vexed the poor and needy: yea, they have oppressed the stranger wrongfully. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:30</font>
<td>
And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it: but I found none. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:31</font>
<td>
Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I recompensed upon their heads, saith the Lord GOD. </table>
