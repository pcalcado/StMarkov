Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say unto him, Thou art like a young lion of the nations, and thou art as a whale in the seas: and thou camest forth with thy rivers, and troubledst the waters with thy feet, and fouledst their rivers. <tr>

And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains, and fill the valleys with thy height. <tr>

I will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest, even to the mountains; and the rivers shall be full of thee. <tr>

Yea, I will make many people amazed at thee, and their kings shall be horribly afraid for thee, when I shall brandish my sword before them; and they shall tremble at every moment, every man for his own life, in the day of thy fall. <tr>
