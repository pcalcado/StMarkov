Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? whither is thy beloved turned aside? that we may seek him with thee. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
6:2</font>
<td>
My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies. <tr>

6:3</font>

I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine: he feedeth among the lilies. <tr>

Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as an army with banners. <tr>

6:5</font>

Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me: thy hair is as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead. <tr>

<font size=-1>
6:6</font>

Thy teeth are as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing, whereof every one beareth twins, and there is not one barren among them. <tr>

As a piece of a pomegranate are thy temples within thy locks. <tr>

There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number. <tr>

<td>
My dove, my undefiled is but one; she is the only one of her mother, she is the choice one of her that bare her. The daughters saw her, and blessed her; yea, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her. <tr>

Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners? <tr>

I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley, and to see whether the vine flourished, and the pomegranates budded. <tr>

Or ever I was aware, my soul made me like the chariots of Amminadib. <tr>

Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite? As it were the company of two armies. </table>
