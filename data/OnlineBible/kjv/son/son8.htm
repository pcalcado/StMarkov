8:1</font>
<td>
O that thou wert as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my mother! when I should find thee without, I would kiss thee; yea, I should not be despised. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:2</font>
<td>
I would lead thee, and bring thee into my mother's house, who would instruct me: I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:3</font>
<td>
His left hand should be under my head, and his right hand should embrace me. <tr>

8:4</font>
<td>
I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, until he please. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:5</font>
<td>
Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved? I raised thee up under the apple tree: there thy mother brought thee forth: there she brought thee forth that bare thee. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:6</font>
<td>
Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:7</font>
<td>
Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:8</font>
<td>
We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:9</font>
<td>
If she be a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver: and if she be a door, we will inclose her with boards of cedar. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:10</font>
<td>
I am a wall, and my breasts like towers: then was I in his eyes as one that found favour. <tr>
<td valign=top>

8:11</font>
<td>
Solomon had a vineyard at Baalhamon; he let out the vineyard unto keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:12</font>
<td>
My vineyard, which is mine, is before me: thou, O Solomon, must have a thousand, and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:13</font>
<td>
Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the companions hearken to thy voice: cause me to hear it. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:14</font>
<td>
Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices. </table>
