2:1</font>
<td>
I am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:2</font>
<td>
As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:3</font>
<td>
As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:4</font>
<td>
He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was love. <tr>
<td valign=top>

2:5</font>
<td>
Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I am sick of love. <tr>

His left hand is under my head, and his right hand doth embrace me. <tr>

2:7</font>
<td>
I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, till he please. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:8</font>

The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:9</font>
<td>
My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold, he standeth behind our wall, he looketh forth at the windows, shewing himself through the lattice. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:10</font>
<td>
My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:11</font>
<td>
For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:12</font>
<td>
The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing of birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:13</font>
<td>
The fig tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:14</font>
<td>
O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely. <tr>
<td valign=top>

2:15</font>
<td>
Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for our vines have tender grapes. <tr>

2:16</font>
<td>
My beloved is mine, and I am his: he feedeth among the lilies. <tr>

2:17</font>
<td>
Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether. </table>
