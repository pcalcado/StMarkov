Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:2</font>
<td>
And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:3</font>
<td>
And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:4</font>
<td>
And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:5</font>
<td>
And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:6</font>
<td>
He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:7</font>
<td>
Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:8</font>
<td>
And they remembered his words, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:9</font>
<td>
And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:10</font>
<td>
It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, which told these things unto the apostles. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:11</font>
<td>
And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:12</font>

Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:13</font>
<td>
And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:14</font>
<td>
And they talked together of all these things which had happened. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:15</font>
<td>
And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:16</font>
<td>
But their eyes were holden that they should not know him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:17</font>
<td>
And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:18</font>
<td>
And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:19</font>
<td>
And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:20</font>
<td>
And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:21</font>
<td>
But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:22</font>
<td>
Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:23</font>
<td>
And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:24</font>
<td>
And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:25</font>
<td>
Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:26</font>
<td>
Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:27</font>
<td>
And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:28</font>
<td>
And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:29</font>
<td>
But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:30</font>
<td>
And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:31</font>
<td>
And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:32</font>
<td>
And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:33</font>
<td>
And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:34</font>
<td>
Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:35</font>
<td>
And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:36</font>
<td>
And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:37</font>
<td>
But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:38</font>
<td>
And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:39</font>
<td>
Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:40</font>
<td>
And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:41</font>
<td>
And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:42</font>
<td>
And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:43</font>
<td>
And he took it, and did eat before them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:44</font>
<td>
And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:45</font>
<td>
Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:46</font>
<td>
And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:47</font>
<td>
And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:48</font>
<td>
And ye are witnesses of these things. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:49</font>
<td>
And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:50</font>
<td>
And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:51</font>
<td>
And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:52</font>
<td>
And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
24:53</font>
<td>
And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen. </table>
