Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the Passover. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:2</font>
<td>
And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him; for they feared the people. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:3</font>
<td>
Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:4</font>
<td>
And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray him unto them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:5</font>
<td>
And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:6</font>
<td>
And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:7</font>
<td>
Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be killed. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:8</font>
<td>
And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the passover, that we may eat. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:9</font>
<td>
And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:10</font>
<td>
And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he entereth in. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:11</font>
<td>
And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master saith unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:12</font>
<td>
And he shall shew you a large upper room furnished: there make ready. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:13</font>
<td>
And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:14</font>
<td>
And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:15</font>
<td>
And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:16</font>
<td>
For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:17</font>
<td>
And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:18</font>
<td>
For I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:19</font>
<td>
And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:20</font>
<td>
Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:21</font>
<td>
But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:22</font>
<td>
And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined: but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed! <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:23</font>
<td>
And they began to enquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:24</font>
<td>
And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:25</font>
<td>
And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:26</font>
<td>
But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:27</font>
<td>
For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as he that serveth. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:28</font>
<td>
Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:29</font>
<td>
And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:30</font>
<td>
That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:31</font>
<td>
And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:32</font>
<td>
But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:33</font>
<td>
And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:34</font>
<td>
And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:35</font>
<td>
And he said unto them, When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:36</font>
<td>
Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:37</font>
<td>
For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:38</font>
<td>
And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said unto them, It is enough. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:39</font>
<td>
And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:40</font>
<td>
And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:41</font>
<td>
And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kneeled down, and prayed, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:42</font>
<td>
Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:43</font>
<td>
And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:44</font>
<td>
And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:45</font>
<td>
And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:46</font>
<td>
And said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:47</font>
<td>
And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:48</font>
<td>
But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:49</font>
<td>
When they which were about him saw what would follow, they said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:50</font>
<td>
And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:51</font>
<td>
And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:52</font>
<td>
Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:53</font>
<td>
When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:54</font>
<td>
Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high priest's house. And Peter followed afar off. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:55</font>
<td>
And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were set down together, Peter sat down among them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:56</font>
<td>
But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:57</font>
<td>
And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:58</font>
<td>
And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:59</font>
<td>
And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him: for he is a Galilaean. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:60</font>
<td>
And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:61</font>
<td>
And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:62</font>
<td>
And Peter went out, and wept bitterly. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:63</font>
<td>
And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:64</font>
<td>
And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:65</font>
<td>
And many other things blasphemously spake they against him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:66</font>
<td>
And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:67</font>
<td>
Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:68</font>
<td>
And if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:69</font>
<td>
Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:70</font>
<td>
Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Ye say that I am. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
22:71</font>
<td>
And they said, What need we any further witness? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth. </table>
