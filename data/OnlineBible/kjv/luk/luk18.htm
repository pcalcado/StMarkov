18:1</font>
<td>
And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:2</font>
<td>
Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:3</font>
<td>
And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:4</font>
<td>
And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:5</font>
<td>
Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:6</font>
<td>
And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:7</font>
<td>
And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:8</font>
<td>
I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:9</font>
<td>
And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:10</font>
<td>
Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:11</font>
<td>
The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:12</font>
<td>
I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:13</font>
<td>
And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:14</font>
<td>
I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:15</font>
<td>
And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:16</font>
<td>
But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:17</font>
<td>
Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:18</font>
<td>
And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:19</font>
<td>
And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none is good, save one, that is, God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:20</font>
<td>
Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:21</font>
<td>
And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:22</font>
<td>
Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:23</font>
<td>
And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:24</font>
<td>
And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God! <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:25</font>
<td>
For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:26</font>
<td>
And they that heard it said, Who then can be saved? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:27</font>
<td>
And he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:28</font>
<td>
Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:29</font>
<td>
And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:30</font>
<td>
Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:31</font>
<td>
Then he took unto him the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:32</font>
<td>
For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:33</font>
<td>
And they shall scourge him, and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise again. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:34</font>
<td>
And they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:35</font>
<td>
And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:36</font>
<td>
And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:37</font>
<td>
And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:38</font>
<td>
And he cried, saying, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:39</font>
<td>
And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more, Thou son of David, have mercy on me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:40</font>
<td>
And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:41</font>
<td>
Saying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:42</font>
<td>
And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
18:43</font>
<td>
And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise unto God. </table>
