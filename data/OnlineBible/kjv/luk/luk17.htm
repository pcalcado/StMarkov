Then said he unto the disciples, It is impossible but that offences will come: but woe unto him, through whom they come! <tr>
<td valign=top>

Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
17:4</font>

And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you. <tr>

<font size=-1>
17:9</font>
<td>
Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
17:10</font>
<td>
So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do. <tr>

17:11</font>

And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee. <tr>

And they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us. <tr>
<td valign=top>

And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go shew yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed. <tr>

And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
17:16</font>

And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
17:17</font>
<td>
And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
17:18</font>
<td>
There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger. <tr>
<td valign=top>

And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
17:20</font>

And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
17:21</font>
<td>
Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
17:22</font>

And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see it. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
17:23</font>
<td>
And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not after them, nor follow them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
17:24</font>
<td>
For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one part under heaven, shineth unto the other part under heaven; so shall also the Son of man be in his day. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
17:25</font>
<td>
But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this generation. <tr>
<td valign=top>

They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all. <tr>
<td valign=top>
