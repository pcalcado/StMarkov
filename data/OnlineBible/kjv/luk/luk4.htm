And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath, <tr>

And in the synagogue there was a man, which had a spirit of an unclean devil, and cried out with a loud voice, <tr>

Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:41</font>
