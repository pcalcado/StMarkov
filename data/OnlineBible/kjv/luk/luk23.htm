And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:2</font>
<td>
And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:3</font>
<td>
And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest it. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:4</font>
<td>
Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:5</font>
<td>
And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:6</font>
<td>
When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:7</font>
<td>
And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:8</font>
<td>
And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:9</font>
<td>
Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:10</font>
<td>
And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:11</font>
<td>
And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:12</font>
<td>
And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:13</font>
<td>
And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:14</font>
<td>
Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:15</font>
<td>
No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:16</font>
<td>
I will therefore chastise him, and release him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:17</font>
<td>
(For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.) <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:18</font>
<td>
And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:19</font>
<td>
(Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.) <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:20</font>
<td>
Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:21</font>
<td>
But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:22</font>
<td>
And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him go. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:23</font>
<td>
And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:24</font>
<td>
And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:25</font>
<td>
And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:26</font>
<td>
And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:27</font>
<td>
And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:28</font>
<td>
But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:29</font>
<td>
For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:30</font>
<td>
Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:31</font>
<td>
For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:32</font>
<td>
And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:33</font>
<td>
And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:34</font>
<td>
Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:35</font>
<td>
And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:36</font>
<td>
And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:37</font>
<td>
And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:38</font>
<td>
And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:39</font>
<td>
And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:40</font>
<td>
But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:41</font>
<td>
And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:42</font>
<td>
And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:43</font>
<td>
And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:44</font>
<td>
And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:45</font>
<td>
And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:46</font>
<td>
And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:47</font>
<td>
Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:48</font>
<td>
And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:49</font>
<td>
And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:50</font>
<td>
And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counsellor; and he was a good man, and a just: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:51</font>
<td>
(The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) he was of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:52</font>
<td>
This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:53</font>
<td>
And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:54</font>
<td>
And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:55</font>
<td>
And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
23:56</font>
<td>
And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment. </table>
