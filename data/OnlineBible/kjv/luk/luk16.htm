16:1</font>
<td>
And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:2</font>
<td>
And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:3</font>
<td>
Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:4</font>
<td>
I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:5</font>
<td>
So he called every one of his lord's debtors unto him, and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:6</font>
<td>
And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:7</font>
<td>
Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:8</font>
<td>
And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:9</font>
<td>
And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:10</font>
<td>
He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:11</font>
<td>
If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:12</font>
<td>
And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:13</font>
<td>
No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:14</font>
<td>
And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:15</font>
<td>
And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:16</font>
<td>
The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:17</font>
<td>
And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:18</font>
<td>
Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth adultery. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:19</font>
<td>
There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:20</font>
<td>
And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:21</font>
<td>
And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:22</font>
<td>
And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:23</font>
<td>
And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:24</font>
<td>
And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:25</font>
<td>
But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:26</font>
<td>
And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:27</font>
<td>
Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:28</font>
<td>
For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:29</font>
<td>
Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:30</font>
<td>
And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
16:31</font>
<td>
And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead. </table>
