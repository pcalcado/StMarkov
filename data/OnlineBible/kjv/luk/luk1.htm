<td>
Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:2</font>
<td>
Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:3</font>
<td>
It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:4</font>
<td>
That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:5</font>
<td>
There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:6</font>
<td>
And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:7</font>
<td>
And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they both were now well stricken in years. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:8</font>
<td>
And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest's office before God in the order of his course, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:9</font>
<td>
According to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:10</font>
<td>
And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:11</font>
<td>
And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:12</font>
<td>
And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:13</font>
<td>
But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:14</font>
<td>
And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:15</font>
<td>
For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:16</font>
<td>
And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:17</font>
<td>
And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:18</font>
<td>
And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:19</font>
<td>
And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:20</font>
<td>
And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:21</font>
<td>
And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:22</font>
<td>
And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned unto them, and remained speechless. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:23</font>
<td>
And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:24</font>
<td>
And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:25</font>
<td>
Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:26</font>
<td>
And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:27</font>
<td>
To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:28</font>
<td>
And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:29</font>
<td>
And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:30</font>
<td>
And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:31</font>
<td>
And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:32</font>
<td>
He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:33</font>
<td>
And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:34</font>
<td>
Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:35</font>
<td>
And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:36</font>
<td>
And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:37</font>
<td>
For with God nothing shall be impossible. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:38</font>
<td>
And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:39</font>
<td>
And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Juda; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:40</font>
<td>
And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:41</font>
<td>
And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:42</font>
<td>
And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:43</font>
<td>
And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:44</font>
<td>
For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:45</font>
<td>
And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:46</font>
<td>
And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:47</font>
<td>
And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:48</font>
<td>
For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:49</font>
<td>
For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy is his name. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:50</font>
<td>
And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:51</font>
<td>
He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:52</font>
<td>
He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:53</font>
<td>
He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:54</font>
<td>
He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:55</font>
<td>
As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for ever. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:56</font>
<td>
And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:57</font>
<td>
Now Elisabeth's full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:58</font>
<td>
And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:59</font>
<td>
And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:60</font>
<td>
And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called John. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:61</font>
<td>
And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:62</font>
<td>
And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:63</font>
<td>
And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marvelled all. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:64</font>
<td>
And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and he spake, and praised God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:65</font>
<td>
And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:66</font>
<td>
And all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of the Lord was with him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:67</font>
<td>
And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:68</font>
<td>
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited and redeemed his people, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:69</font>
<td>
And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:70</font>
<td>
As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:71</font>
<td>
That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:72</font>
<td>
To perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:73</font>
<td>
The oath which he sware to our father Abraham, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:74</font>
<td>
That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:75</font>
<td>
In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:76</font>
<td>
And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:77</font>
<td>
To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:78</font>
<td>
Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:79</font>
<td>
To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:80</font>
<td>
And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel. </table>
