And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
21:3</font>

And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all: <tr>

For all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of God: but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had. <tr>

And as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts, he said, <tr>

As for these things which ye behold, the days will come, in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down. <tr>

And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be? and what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass? <tr>
<td valign=top>

And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and the time draweth near: go ye not therefore after them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
21:9</font>

But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the end is not by and by. <tr>

Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: <tr>
<td valign=top>

And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven. <tr>

But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name's sake. <tr>

For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist. <tr>

And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh. <tr>

<td>
But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck, in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath upon this people. <tr>
<td valign=top>

And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled. <tr>
<td valign=top>

Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away. <tr>
