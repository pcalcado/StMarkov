Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
30:9</font>
<td>
Lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is the LORD? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God in vain. <tr>

There be three things which are too wonderful for me, yea, four which I know not: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
30:19</font>
<td>
The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid. <tr>
<td valign=top>

For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled with meat; <tr>
<td valign=top>
