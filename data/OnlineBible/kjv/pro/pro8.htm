<td>
Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:2</font>
<td>
She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:3</font>
<td>
She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:4</font>
<td>
Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:5</font>
<td>
O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:6</font>
<td>
Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips shall be right things. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:7</font>
<td>
For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness is an abomination to my lips. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:8</font>
<td>
All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is nothing froward or perverse in them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:9</font>
<td>
They are all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:10</font>
<td>
Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:11</font>
<td>
For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:12</font>
<td>
I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:13</font>
<td>
The fear of the LORD is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:14</font>
<td>
Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have strength. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:15</font>
<td>
By me kings reign, and princes decree justice. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:16</font>
<td>
By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:17</font>
<td>
I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:18</font>
<td>
Riches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches and righteousness. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:19</font>
<td>
My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:20</font>
<td>
I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:21</font>
<td>
That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:22</font>
<td>
The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:23</font>
<td>
I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:24</font>
<td>
When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding with water. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:25</font>
<td>
Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:26</font>
<td>
While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:27</font>
<td>
When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:28</font>
<td>
When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:29</font>
<td>
When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:30</font>
<td>
Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:31</font>
<td>
Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:32</font>
<td>
Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed are they that keep my ways. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:33</font>
<td>
Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:34</font>
<td>
Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:35</font>
<td>
For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the LORD. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
8:36</font>

But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me love death. </table>
