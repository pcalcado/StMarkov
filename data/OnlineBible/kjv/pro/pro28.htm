Whoso keepeth the law is a wise son: but he that is a companion of riotous men shameth his father. <tr>

He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
28:10</font>
<td>
Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way, he shall fall himself into his own pit: but the upright shall have good things in possession. <tr>
<td valign=top>

The rich man is wise in his own conceit; but the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out. <tr>

When righteous men do rejoice, there is great glory: but when the wicked rise, a man is hidden. <tr>

He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy. <tr>

Happy is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief. <tr>

To have respect of persons is not good: for for a piece of bread that man will transgress. <tr>

He that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye, and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him. <tr>

<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
28:26</font>
<td>
He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>

When the wicked rise, men hide themselves: but when they perish, the righteous increase. </table>
