3:1</font>
<td>
Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:2</font>
<td>
Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:3</font>
<td>
And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:4</font>
<td>
Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:5</font>
<td>
And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:6</font>
<td>
Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:7</font>
<td>
Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:8</font>
<td>
He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:9</font>
<td>
Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:10</font>
<td>
In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:11</font>
<td>
For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:12</font>
<td>
Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:13</font>
<td>
Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:14</font>
<td>
We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:15</font>
<td>
Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:16</font>
<td>
Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:17</font>
<td>
But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:18</font>
<td>
My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:19</font>
<td>
And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:20</font>
<td>
For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:21</font>
<td>
Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:22</font>
<td>
And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:23</font>
<td>
And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:24</font>
<td>
And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us. </table>
