3:1</font>
<td>
Now these are the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel by them, even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:2</font>
<td>
Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:3</font>
<td>
Namely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baalhermon unto the entering in of Hamath. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:4</font>
<td>
And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:5</font>
<td>
And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:6</font>
<td>
And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:7</font>
<td>
And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgat the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the groves. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:8</font>
<td>
Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushanrishathaim eight years. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:9</font>
<td>
And when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:10</font>
<td>
And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:11</font>
<td>
And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:12</font>
<td>
And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:13</font>
<td>
And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:14</font>
<td>
So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:15</font>
<td>
But when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man lefthanded: and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of Moab. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:16</font>
<td>
But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:17</font>
<td>
And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon was a very fat man. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:18</font>
<td>
And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bare the present. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:19</font>
<td>
But he himself turned again from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king: who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:20</font>
<td>
And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of his seat. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:21</font>
<td>
And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:22</font>
<td>
And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:23</font>
<td>
Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlour upon him, and locked them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:24</font>
<td>
When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlour were locked, they said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:25</font>
<td>
And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a key, and opened them: and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:26</font>
<td>
And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirath. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:27</font>
<td>
And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:28</font>
<td>
And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the LORD hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:29</font>
<td>
And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:30</font>
<td>
So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:31</font>
<td>
And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered Israel. </table>
