Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:2</font>
<td>
Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:3</font>
<td>
I thank my God upon every remembrance of you, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:4</font>
<td>
Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:5</font>
<td>
For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:6</font>
<td>
Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:7</font>
<td>
Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:8</font>
<td>
For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:9</font>
<td>
And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:10</font>
<td>
That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:11</font>
<td>
Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:12</font>
<td>
But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:13</font>
<td>
So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other places; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:14</font>
<td>
And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:15</font>
<td>
Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:16</font>
<td>
The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:17</font>
<td>
But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:18</font>
<td>
What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:19</font>
<td>
For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:20</font>
<td>
According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:21</font>
<td>
For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:22</font>
<td>
But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:23</font>
<td>
For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:24</font>
<td>
Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:25</font>
<td>
And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:26</font>
<td>
That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:27</font>
<td>
Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:28</font>
<td>
And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:29</font>
<td>
For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:30</font>
<td>
Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me. </table>
