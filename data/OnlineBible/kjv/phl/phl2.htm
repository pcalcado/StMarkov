2:1</font>
<td>
If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:2</font>
<td>
Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:3</font>
<td>
Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:4</font>
<td>
Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:5</font>
<td>
Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:6</font>
<td>
Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:7</font>
<td>
But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:8</font>
<td>
And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:9</font>
<td>
Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:10</font>
<td>
That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:11</font>
<td>
And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:12</font>
<td>
Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:13</font>
<td>
For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:14</font>
<td>
Do all things without murmurings and disputings: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:15</font>
<td>
That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:16</font>
<td>
Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:17</font>
<td>
Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:18</font>
<td>
For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:19</font>
<td>
But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:20</font>
<td>
For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:21</font>
<td>
For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:22</font>
<td>
But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:23</font>
<td>
Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:24</font>
<td>
But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:25</font>
<td>
Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:26</font>
<td>
For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:27</font>
<td>
For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:28</font>
<td>
I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:29</font>
<td>
Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:30</font>
<td>
Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me. </table>
