3:1</font>
<td>
My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:2</font>
<td>
For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:3</font>
<td>
Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:4</font>
<td>
Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:5</font>
<td>
Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth! <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:6</font>
<td>
And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:7</font>
<td>
For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:8</font>
<td>
But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:9</font>
<td>
Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:10</font>
<td>
Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:11</font>
<td>
Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:12</font>
<td>
Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:13</font>
<td>
Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:14</font>
<td>
But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:15</font>
<td>
This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:16</font>
<td>
For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:17</font>
<td>
But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
3:18</font>
<td>
And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace. </table>
