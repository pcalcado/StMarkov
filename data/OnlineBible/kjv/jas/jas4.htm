4:1</font>
<td>
From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:2</font>
<td>
Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:3</font>
<td>
Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:4</font>
<td>
Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:5</font>
<td>
Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy? <tr>
<td valign=top>

4:6</font>
<td>
But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:7</font>
<td>
Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:8</font>
<td>
Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:9</font>
<td>
Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:10</font>
<td>
Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:11</font>
<td>
Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:12</font>
<td>
There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:13</font>
<td>
Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:14</font>
<td>
Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:15</font>
<td>
For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:16</font>
<td>
But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil. <tr>

4:17</font>
<td>
Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin. </table>
