<td>
James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:2</font>
<td>
My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:3</font>
<td>
Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:4</font>
<td>
But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:5</font>
<td>
If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:6</font>
<td>
But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:7</font>
<td>
For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:8</font>
<td>
A double minded man is unstable in all his ways. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:9</font>
<td>
Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:10</font>
<td>
But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:11</font>
<td>
For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:12</font>
<td>
Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:13</font>
<td>
Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:14</font>
<td>
But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:15</font>
<td>
Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:16</font>
<td>
Do not err, my beloved brethren. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:17</font>
<td>
Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:18</font>
<td>
Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:19</font>
<td>
Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:20</font>
<td>
For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:21</font>
<td>
Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:22</font>
<td>
But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:23</font>
<td>
For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:24</font>
<td>
For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:25</font>
<td>
But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:26</font>
<td>
If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
1:27</font>
<td>
Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world. </table>
