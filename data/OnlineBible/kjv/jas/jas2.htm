2:1</font>
<td>
My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:2</font>
<td>
For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:3</font>
<td>
And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:4</font>
<td>
Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:5</font>
<td>
Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:6</font>
<td>
But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:7</font>
<td>
Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:8</font>
<td>
If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:9</font>
<td>
But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:10</font>
<td>
For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:11</font>
<td>
For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:12</font>
<td>
So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:13</font>
<td>
For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:14</font>
<td>
What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:15</font>
<td>
If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:16</font>
<td>
And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:17</font>
<td>
Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:18</font>
<td>
Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:19</font>
<td>
Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:20</font>
<td>
But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:21</font>
<td>
Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:22</font>
<td>
Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:23</font>
<td>
And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:24</font>
<td>
Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:25</font>
<td>
Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:26</font>
<td>
For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also. </table>
