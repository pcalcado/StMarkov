And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:2</font>
<td>
And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:3</font>
<td>
Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:4</font>
<td>
And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:5</font>
<td>
And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:6</font>
<td>
But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:7</font>
<td>
And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:8</font>
<td>
And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:9</font>
<td>
And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:10</font>
<td>
And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:11</font>
<td>
And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all these things are done in parables: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:12</font>
<td>
That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:13</font>
<td>
And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how then will ye know all parables? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:14</font>
<td>
The sower soweth the word. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:15</font>
<td>
And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:16</font>
<td>
And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:17</font>
<td>
And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake, immediately they are offended. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:18</font>
<td>
And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:19</font>
<td>
And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:20</font>
<td>
And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:21</font>
<td>
And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:22</font>
<td>
For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:23</font>
<td>
If any man have ears to hear, let him hear. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:24</font>
<td>
And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:25</font>
<td>
For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:26</font>
<td>
And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:27</font>
<td>
And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:28</font>
<td>
For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:29</font>
<td>
But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:30</font>
<td>
And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:31</font>
<td>
It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:32</font>
<td>
But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:33</font>
<td>
And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear it. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:34</font>
<td>
But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:35</font>
<td>
And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:36</font>
<td>
And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:37</font>
<td>
And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:38</font>
<td>
And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:39</font>
<td>
And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:40</font>
<td>
And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
4:41</font>
<td>
And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him? </table>
