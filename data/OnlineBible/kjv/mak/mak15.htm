And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:2</font>
<td>
And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto him, Thou sayest it. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:3</font>
<td>
And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:4</font>
<td>
And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:5</font>
<td>
But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:6</font>
<td>
Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:7</font>
<td>
And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:8</font>
<td>
And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:9</font>
<td>
But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:10</font>
<td>
For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:11</font>
<td>
But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:12</font>
<td>
And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:13</font>
<td>
And they cried out again, Crucify him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:14</font>
<td>
Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:15</font>
<td>
And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified. <tr>

And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band. <tr>
<td valign=top>

And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his head, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:18</font>
<td>
And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews! <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:19</font>
<td>
And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:20</font>
<td>
And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:21</font>
<td>
And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:22</font>
<td>
And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:23</font>
<td>
And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:24</font>
<td>
And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:25</font>
<td>
And it was the third hour, and they crucified him. <tr>

<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:27</font>

<td>
And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors. <tr>
<td valign=top>

<td>
Save thyself, and come down from the cross. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:31</font>
<td>
Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:32</font>
<td>

15:33</font>

And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour. <tr>

<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:35</font>
<td>
And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elias. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:36</font>
<td>
And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
15:37</font>
<td>
And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost. <tr>
<td valign=top>

15:38</font>
<td>
And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom. <tr>
<td valign=top>
