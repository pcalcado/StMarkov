5:1</font>
<td>
For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:2</font>
<td>
For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:3</font>
<td>
If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:4</font>
<td>
For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:5</font>
<td>
Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:6</font>
<td>
Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:7</font>
<td>
(For we walk by faith, not by sight:) <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:8</font>
<td>
We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:9</font>
<td>
Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:10</font>
<td>
For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:11</font>
<td>
Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:12</font>
<td>
For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance, and not in heart. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:13</font>
<td>
For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we be sober, it is for your cause. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:14</font>
<td>
For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:15</font>
<td>
And that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:16</font>
<td>
Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:17</font>
<td>
Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:18</font>
<td>
And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:19</font>
<td>
To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:20</font>
<td>
Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
5:21</font>
<td>
For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. </table>
