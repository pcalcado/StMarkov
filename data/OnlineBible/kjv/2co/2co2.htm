2:1</font>
<td>
But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:2</font>
<td>
For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:3</font>
<td>
And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:4</font>
<td>
For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:5</font>
<td>
But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:6</font>
<td>
Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:7</font>
<td>
So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:8</font>
<td>
Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:9</font>
<td>
For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:10</font>
<td>
To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ; <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:11</font>
<td>
Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:12</font>
<td>
Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord, <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:13</font>
<td>
I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:14</font>
<td>
Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place. <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:15</font>
<td>
For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish: <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:16</font>
<td>
To the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things? <tr>
<td valign=top>
<font size=-1>
2:17</font>
<td>
For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ. </table>
